"`As it may be interesting to my children when I am gone,
to know something of my early religious exercises, I feel inclined to note some of them,
now, at an advanced age; but as I kept no written account at the time,
I cannot mention dates exactly.

"`Being when young made sensible of the visitations of our Heavenly Father`'s love,
which were very precious to me, I was led to desire a continuance of them;
and a sense was given me, if I did not strive to be a good child,
I should not be thus favored.
As I advanced in age,
my youthful mind was often tempted to deviate from the straight and narrow way,
and as often as I did, I was brought under condemnation,
when no one knew it but He who in mercy had administered it.
Being thus favored with the convictions of Truth from season to season,
kept me in fear and care lest I should do wrong.

"`After I grew to womanhood, I met with disappointments and cross occurrences,
which greatly humbled me, and tended to break down my strong will,
so that I seemed as one chastened of the Lord: and the language of my heart at times was,
'`turn thou me, and I shall be turned;
for thou art the Lord my God.`' In this humiliating season it was given
me to believe that my Heavenly Father had a work for me to do,
and that it would be required of me to open my mouth in his cause among the people,
which was very weighty to me,
and gladly would I have felt excused from such a prospect.`"

+++[+++The following letter, written about the year 1796, will show the tenderly visited,
and thoroughly awakened state of Hannah Pusey`'s mind at that time:
a state of sore conflict, and of being baptised into death,
preparatory to that resurrection unto newness of life, which is in Christ Jesus,
and whereby we are fitted for service in the Church and in the world.
How precious is this season of espousal!
Wherein not only the warfare which '`is with burning
and fuel of fire,`' is in measure experienced,
but the penitent mind is brought to cry unto him in humility and contrition,
under a lively sense of the Redeemer`'s power, and its need of help:]

--

Thou art kind, my endeared cousin, in remembering me from time to time.
May our faith be increased,
and our love to Christ and one unto another never give out while in this state of mutability.
Although I have not written to thee for a long time, I have not ceased to love thee,
except in seasons wherein it would be hard for me to say I loved anyone.
Such hath been the sealed state of my mind,
that all the comforts and consolations hitherto attendant, were indeed a fountain sealed;
a trying, proving state, wherein faith hath been almost ready to waver.
But blessed is the Shepherd of Israel, his compassions fail not, I firmly believe,
to those who are feebly looking toward his holy habitation,
and are ready to adopt this language, '`to whom shall we go?
Thou hast the words of eternal life.`'

Now I am sensible, my dear cousin, that I am a very poor creature,
and herein have had to admire at the wonderful dealings
and condescension of our Heavenly Parent.
Well may we exclaim with the Psalmist, '`What is man that thou art mindful of him,
or the son of man that thou visitest him?`' Ready indeed is He,
when we are thoroughly sensible of error,
to seal our pardon with a plenteous shower of heavenly dew;
that may we not say of a truth,
'`He will abundantly pardon.`' My heart expands at seasons
in the joyful prospect of obtaining the crown at last,
provided the good fight is fought, and the faith kept.
Is not the hope encouraging, my dear cousin, that,
after all the conflicts permitted to attend us in this state of probation,
there is a blessed inheritance prepared in that city,
none of whose inhabitants can say I am sick?
I find upon looking over the past scenes of my life,
that there has been a great unwillingness in me from season to season,
to submit to the government of the cross: whereby chastisement hath been incurred.
Oh that I was faithfully dedicated to the Lord`'s service!
But the enemy fails not to cast in his baits and snares, whereby the conflict is renewed,
and the warfare sometimes so great that I have feared being overwhelmed in the contest.
However, after all,
I believe nothing short of obedience to what appears to be the manifestations of Truth,
will yield that peace, which my soul at seasons longs for.

I think I am favored at this time with a degree of that love which tenderly salutes thee;
and it is indeed a favor to feel our friends in the bonds of endeared affection.
I have never been so sensible of this as of latter time,
and that of ourselves we can do nothing.
Therefore may we lean on Him who is strength in weakness,
and a present help in the needful time.
I cannot help feeling a wish for the improvement of others,
though I am a poor creature myself.
Now, my dear cousin, when it is well with thee,
remember her who is often in a conflicting state,
but who still remains to be thy affectionate cousin,

"`When about the 26th or 27th year of my age, a Friend, Mary Swayne,
from another Monthly Meeting,
came to ours with a minute expressive of her concern to visit the families of it.
I was one appointed to accompany her, and in the course of the visit, felt constrained,
I trust by the power of Divine love, to bend the knee in this my first appearance,
and vocally to supplicate the Father of mercies, for the blessing of preservation;
and that He would be pleased to enable us of the younger class, to be faithful unto Him.
After this, to me, awful season, I felt myself in a state of humiliation and fear;
was more bound to my elder friends with whom I was associated,
and more resigned to proceed with them.
Subsequently in the course of the visit,
I ventured to open my mouth a few times by way of testimony, and afterwards was favored,
I trust I may say, with a degree of holy quiet of mind.`"

[.signed-section-context-open]
3rd month 18th, 1798

I was very glad, my dear brother, to receive a letter from thee,
as also the intelligence respecting our brother.
I have often sympathized with them in their seeming rugged path through this world,
wherein many thorns have been, as it were, interspersed: and what is the cause?
Is it not evident that the chastening Hand of an Almighty Father hath been stretched out,
and Oh that the language of their hearts may be like Ephraim formerly, '`turn thou me,
and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.`'

I often admire at the wonderful dealings and condescension of our Heavenly Father,
who follows us from season to season, and as a voice intelligibly speaking in secret,
this is the way, walk in it.
How unwilling are we to submit to the government of the cross,
because we cannot fully gratify our natural inclinations: but I firmly believe,
my dear brother, there is a precious liberty in the Truth,
to which we are strangers while we continue in an unregenerated state.
Therefore may we be so wise as to close in with the offers of His love,
who willeth not the death of any, but that all should repent, return and live.
Such is the condescending goodness of our Heavenly Shepherd pleading with us in mercy,
and then by judgment, that so, if possible,
we may be saved and preserved from the many snares
and temptations which at times grievously beset us.
For the enemy of our souls`' happiness is very busy, endeavoring to enlarge his kingdom;
that I wish, my dear brother, we may more and more look to the Lord,
whose ways are pleasantness, and all his paths, to the humble mind, are peace.
I did not expect to have written so much in this way when I began,
but as things have occurred I have penned them,
and hope thou wilt receive it in the flowings of love in which it is written,
knowing that I have as much need perhaps as anyone,
to be industrious in the heavenly journey.

[.signed-section-closing]
In love I am thy truly affectionate sister,

+++[+++Her diary continues:]

"`In the year 1799 my beloved and aforesaid friend, Mary Swayne,
felt a concern to visit the meetings of Fairfax Quarterly Meeting, in Virginia;
and having the approbation of Friends, I accompanied her through the visit,
of which there is an account elsewhere preserved.^
footnote:[This account states the visit occupied about seven weeks, during which,
many meetings were attended, and exercising seasons experienced; but in conclusion,
she says, "`I returned home with a gladdened heart, and could say, of a truth,
our Heavenly Father is not an hard Master.`"
The journey was made on horseback.]

"`Sometime after my return from the journey above-mentioned,
I was solicited in marriage by William Gibbons, son of Abraham and Lydia Gibbons,
of an adjoining county.
The subject to me felt very weighty,
and I trust we both were desirous of seeking for
Divine direction in the proposed important step.
But after endeavoring solidly to weigh it, momentous as indeed it was,
and the way appearing open to proceed, we were accordingly married at Friends Meeting,
London Grove, 9th of 12th month, 1801, when I was in the 31st year of my age.
In a little time I removed to the home of my beloved husband in Lancaster Co.,
and became a member of Sadsbury Monthly Meeting.
Feeling the responsibilities of my new line of life, my mind was often turned inward,
with desires that I might be enabled to fulfill my duty according to Divine appointment,
and also to act agreeably to my beloved family; my husband having,
in addition to a daughter by a former marriage,
a sister and half brother living with him.

"`I think it was within two years after the event just alluded to,
I accompanied Mary Dickenson of the same (Sadsbury) Monthly Meeting,
to the meetings of Concord Quarterly Meeting.
It was a humiliating time to me, and yielded to, much in the cross to my natural will;
yet afterwards, the visit in retrospect, was productive of peace.
About this time also,
Friends gave me liberty to sit with them in their Select Meetings as an approved minister.
My mind was frequently brought under exercise respecting my religious duty,
and as often I could truly say with the Apostle,
'`when I would do good evil is present with me,`'
which occasioned great conflict of spirit;
but as there was a seeking for patience under exercise,
the language of my heart at seasons was,
'`thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.`'

"`Having felt a concern for some time to visit the
Monthly Meetings of Caln Quarterly Meeting,
and believing it right to mention it in our Monthly Meeting, I did so in much fear;
and having obtained its concurrence, my friends John Kendal and Sarah Webster,
being willing to go with me, we accordingly performed the service,
much to the relief and peace of my mind.

"`Jane Cope, wife of Abiah Cope, a Friend of Bradford Monthly Meeting,
came to our Monthly Meeting with a concern to visit the families of it;
and feeling engaged to join her in a part thereof, I accordingly,
Friends uniting therewith, proceeded as far as way opened,
and was favored to return to my family with an evidence
of having been in the way of my religious duty.

"`After some time my mind became impressed with a concern
to visit the families of Little Britain Monthly Meeting,
which seemed indeed too weighty for me:
but as the concern continued increasingly to press upon me,
I was made willing to open it to my Friends, and they approving of the prospect,
and my beloved friend Lydia Brinton being willing to accompany me,
we attended the aforesaid Monthly Meeting; and after obtaining its concurrence,
set out on the visit, which was indeed arduous: but I was favored to get through,
and a hope was felt that no harm was done.
Yet if more singleness of eye, more simple dedication to the pointings of Truth,
had been kept to on all occasions by me,
I believe I should have returned home more peacefully.
Gracious Father! be pleased to keep me near unto thyself,
and remove all within me which leads into the will of the creature,
and opposes thy blessed will; '`lest while I am preaching unto others,
I myself should become a castaway.`'

"`Having had sufficient cause to believe that my settling in life, through mercy,
was consistent with my Heavenly Father`'s will,
it was a great strength to my poor mind in after trials.
One of which was our having a helpless child.
He was of a delicate constitution, requiring much care by night as well as by day,
yet his life was lengthened to more than eighteen years: he could neither speak nor walk,
and was a striking instance that parents cannot
give to their children strength of limbs,
nor use of senses, but are altogether dependent on Him who made us.
The dear child was taken from us in the 2nd month, 1826, and my step-daughter,
Massey Carpenter, a widow, the 12th of the 10th month, following.
Also our son, Joshua Gibbons, died ten days after.
He was a promising youth in his 21st year.
Thus were our hopes in him cut off, no doubt in unerring wisdom.

"`I had been under exercise of mind for some time before,
in the prospect of attending Baltimore Yearly Meeting,
and was resigned to mention it in our Monthly Meeting about the beginning of 10th month,
and was liberated for the service.
Upon returning from the Monthly Meeting, I found our dear son very ill,
and he continued so about three weeks.
It was a time of much searching of heart with me, and close proving,
yet I did not feel released from the prospect,
but was enabled to commit my cause to Him who knew best what was best for me.
Our dear son, I trust, was favored to make a peaceful close.

"`The next day after his remains were laid in the grave,
I left home in company with my friends Samuel Gibbons, (a cousin), and Sarah Webster;
and although I parted with my dear husband under much trial,
my mind was sustained in quiet trust,
and that evening at a Friend`'s house where we lodged, in Little York,
the language sweetly revived, '`Great peace have they who keep thy law,
and nothing shall offend them;`' which was reviving to my drooping spirit,
and I thought an evidence of Divine regard.
Next evening when we drew near to a Friend`'s house of the name of Matthews,
not far from Little Falls Meeting, which we had a prospect of attending next day,
my mind became unusually drawn in a different direction,
which caused me much searching of heart,
accompanied with a fear lest I had been mistaken
in my prospect of attending meeting there,
yet could not see but that it would be right for me to do so.
The impression remaining with increasing weight,
I ventured next morning to open my exercise to my female companion,
also to the female head of the family where we lodged;
the former being in the station of an elder, and the latter a minister.
I let them know that my mind as we came near the house,
had been drawn impressively south of the road,
and as I had endeavored to weigh the matter,
it seemed to me there might be someone sick, or in other affliction not far from there;
adding, it is a trial to me thus to expose myself,
but I could not feel easy without doing so, and if I am mistaken,
I have been encouraged by the remembrance I am among my friends.
Mary Matthews soon replied,
there is a Friend under affliction not far distant in that direction,
who has been confined to bed for several years, and is glad to see her friends.
This was indeed relieving to me,
yet another difficulty arose from the prospect of
our time being limited to get to Baltimore that evening,
after attending Little Falls Meeting; but our kind friends where we lodged and dined,
so made way for us, that we got to see the afflicted Friend without much loss of time;
and a truly comforting visit it was to me, and I believe it was so to the visited.
Indeed I thought our joy was full in being made sensible
of the overshadowing of Divine regard,
so that we parted in much tenderness, and I believe I may say with thankful hearts.
Thus our Heavenly Father is pleased at seasons not only
to make known the knowledge of His will to his little ones,
but also to give strength to perform it:
and not withstanding the wheel of our carriage broke on the way,
we attended Little Falls Meeting, as first proposed, to our satisfaction,
and got safely to Baltimore before it was late that evening.
Thus way was made, where for a time I could see no way,
confirming the assurance that '`without faith it is impossible to please God.`'

"`After attending the Yearly Meeting I was favored to return to my lonely family,
under a sense of Divine goodness.
It may be worthy of note that Little Falls Meeting was one I felt easy to omit
attending when on a visit to the meetings in those parts sometime before,
in which my dear husband and Sarah Webster were my companions.`"

+++[+++The foregoing account of the period prior to the year 1827,
was penned from memory when in the 85th year of her age.
After that time, she says:]

"`I began to keep some written account of my mental exercises,
which has been continued at times ever since; to which,`" she adds,
"`the former may be considered as an introduction.`"

"`6th month 17th, 1827.
In the morning, before meeting,
my mind was drawn into stillness and waiting before the Lord.
I thought I felt Him to be near for my comfort,
and something like this language seemed spoken:
I look upon thee with an eye of compassion and forgiveness;
at which my often tried mind was made to rejoice,
and desires were renewedly raised that I might never distrust the Lord`'s mercy.

"`23rd. Had the company of our dearly beloved friend Stephen Grellet;
the weight of whose spirit and instructive conversation were comfortable and encouraging;
also his gospel labors at our meeting, and in our family,
were to me as a brook by the way.
The language now arises, '`Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.`'

"`8th month 5th. After having passed some days of close conflict and besetment of mind,
wherein I remembered the temptations our Holy Redeemer passed through,
a little ability was given to supplicate for the blessing of preservation,
whereby my mind is again restored to a comfortable degree of quiet;
and the following portion of the Scriptures of Truth frequently and encouragingly arises,
'`the name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and are safe.`'

"`9th month 13th. In the morning, being exercised in spirit, I was drawn into retirement;
and after some time, a comfortable feeling was experienced,
wherein I remembered how it was with Jacob, when on his way to Padan-Aram,
where he thus expressed himself:--'`surely this is none other than the house of God,
and this is the gate of Heaven;`' and a renewed covenant was entered into,
that if He who was with the Patriarch, would be with me in the way I should go,
that He should be my God and I would serve Him.

"`10th month 16th. My dear husband left home this
morning in order to attend the Meeting for Sufferings.
I feel somewhat alone, though my mind is preserved in a good degree of quiet,
which I esteem a favor.
The breathing of it is for wisdom and an understanding heart,
how to go in and out before the Lord acceptably; that I may indeed know His blessed will,
and have strength to perform it in this day of deep probation and trial.

"`1st month 3rd, 1828.
Although the enemy has been permitted sorely to beset and afflict me,
yet blessed be the name of Israel`'s God, He remains to be a rock of defence,
to those who keep near to Him, helping them again and again,
raising their heads above the billows which seem almost ready to overwhelm.
Gracious Father, keep me near unto thyself,
and preserve me from distrust in thy goodness and mercy.
Though a poor unworthy worm of the dust,
thou hast once more condescended to show compassion, and to say, '`Peace,
be still;`' confirming in the faith that Thy name remains to be a strong tower.`"

+++[+++About this time Hannah Gibbons thus pours out her soul in fervent prayer
for her family--those whom God had given her--that He would bless and
water their souls with the spiritual increase that is of and through Him.
What a rich blessing often attends these exercises!
And how are such religiously concerned parents, with their secret breathings,
or their more open petitions to the God and Father of us all, missed,
when called from their respective places here on earth:]

[.small-break]
'''

"`Be pleased,`" she says, "`O Lord, to bless my dear husband and our tender offspring;
gather the minds of the dear children unto thyself, that so they may come, more and more,
to know Thee to be their help in every time of need.
Preserve our dear son, I pray Thee, from all the wiles of an unwearied enemy.
Be pleased, Oh!
Father, to visit his mind again and again,
until he is made willing to become as the passive clay in thy Holy Hand:
that so he may be a vessel formed for thy use and service,
growing from the stature of a babe, to the fulness of a man in Thee.
Preserve our dear daughters.
O Father! clothe them, I beseech Thee, with a meek and quiet spirit.
Bring them unto Thy banqueting house,
where Thy banner over them shall be love.
Be pleased to keep them through the slippery paths of youth,
that so they may be of the number of those who honor
Thee with the dedication of their whole hearts.

"`10th month 6th, 1830.
Having returned from our Monthly Meeting, I feel the covering of peace to attend my mind,
which I esteem a great favor;
an evidence mercifully vouchsafed that an eye has been kept to the pointings of Truth.
It is a time wherein there are many causes for exercise,
and the day calls for diligence in the employment of our several gifts.
Gracious Father, enable us to keep our eye single unto Thee in faithfulness.

"`11th month 21st. Having passed through a low season,
wherein discouragements poured into my drooping mind as a flood,
and faith seemed almost ready to fail,
these consoling impressions arose in our meeting this morning,
which I humbly trust were of a Divine nature; Let none of those things hinder thee:
He that hath been with thee is still with thee, and as thou casts thy care upon Him,
and art attentive and faithful to all his requiring,
He will be with thee even unto the end.
At which my spirit was brought into contrition before the Most High,
who I believe in mercy condescended to my low condition,
and desires were renewedly raised that I might be helped to be watchful and vigilant.

"`5th month 28th, 1831.
Under some indisposition of body,
I was brought into a state of exercise and waiting before the Most High,
being renewedly made sensible of the necessity we
have of laboring to keep on the whole armor of light,
that so we may be enabled to stand against the wiles of an unwearied adversary.

"`7th month 3rd. Feeling my mind exercised,
desires were raised that I might be wholly dedicated to the Lord;
that I might be directed, sustained,
and preserved by the word of His power--the sincere milk of the word;
and that light might be mercifully afforded to shine
upon the path allotted me from time to time,
even unto the end; not looking for great things,
but simply moving forward in the littleness, having faith in Him,
who hitherto hath been the helper and preserver of His people.

"`10th month 25th. I have remembered the saying of the Apostle,
'`But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves,
but in God who raiseth the dead.`' Feeling something, as I believe,
of His reviving power this morning, my mind is clothed with thankfulness,
that such a poor worm of the dust should be remembered by our Holy Helper,
and raised as it were out of an horrible pit, and my feet, I trust, in some degree,
set upon a rock, even the rock of His power;
and Oh that I may continue to trust in that Power which alone can save us,
and which in former days caused the earth to help the woman,
after whom the dragon cast floods out of his mouth, in order to overwhelm her.

"`2nd month 28th, 1832.
I have passed a trying winter on account of the indisposition
and decease of my dearly beloved husband,
which took place 1st month 16th;
yet the time has not been spent without seasons of sweet consolation,
which I trust have been afforded by the Author of all good.
May I continue to commemorate His mercies.
My dear children and myself, feel, deeply feel, our bereavement;
and my present prevailing desire is,
that He who has thus seen meet to deprive us of our outward stay,
may in His mercy condescend to be a Father to the fatherless, and a Husband to the widow,
enabling us to be resigned to His blessed will.

"`3rd month. Having passed through trials of various kinds,
and my own shortcomings and unfitness for any good
work being painfully felt for some time;
condescending goodness in unmerited mercy vouchsafed
in His own time to strengthen my faith,
and give me consolingly to believe, I was yet under his notice:
attended with a precious feeling, which continued for some days.
May I be sufficiently thankful for this, and every other mercy.

"`4th month 25th. Returned from our Yearly Meeting,
and also a visit to some of my relations.
I think we were favored with a good meeting.
I found my family well after an absence of nearly two weeks;
for which I trust I feel a degree of thankfulness.
My friends having thought right to appoint me one of a committee
to visit the Quarterly and subordinate meetings,
the desire of my heart is, if I should live to enter on the service,
that my eye may be kept single,
and my mind attentive to the guidance of the Shepherd of Israel.

"`5th month 28th. I returned home after an absence of nearly two weeks,
having attended the Quarterly Meetings of Caln, Concord, and Western,
with a few other meetings in the intermediate time (in company with a part of
the before mentioned committee) which affords a comfortable retrospect.

"`6th month 25th. Feeling humbled this morning in our meeting,
a little ability was given to supplicate vocally,
that we might be more effectually purged from the dross, and tin, and reprobate silver,
and helped on in the way which is well pleasing in the Divine sight;
and that the dear youth might be enabled to enter into covenant with the Lord our Maker,
even a perpetual covenant, never to be broken:
serving Him faithfully in their day and generation.
My mind afterward was favored with a degree of sweet peace;
for which I desire to be thankful to the Author of all our blessings.

"`7th month 21st. A day of close trial,
lest I had left undone that which ought to have been done.
My mind was brought very low,
with scarcely ability to look to the habitation of the Holy One.

"`22nd. He, who at seasons, is pleased to revive the heart of the humble,
condescended in mercy to strengthen as with a little of His saving help,
and a little ability was afforded, to labor in the gift,
after which my mind was more comfortable.
Blessed be the name of the Lord: he casteth down and raiseth up:
may I ever keep near him; and, though he slay me, yet may I trust in Him.

"`10th month 7th. Before I arose in the morning, being exercised,
the following impressions were made on my mind: Though the enemy may roar against thee,
he shall not be permitted to overwhelm thee.
A consoling evidence, which left my mind favored with a peaceful quiet through the day;
for which I desire to be thankful to the Author of all our blessings.

"`16th. Soon after waking,
and in the prospect before me of attending Baltimore Yearly Meeting,
the following comfortable impressions were felt:
'`No evil shall befall thee.`' A comfortable quiet day succeeded.
Early the following morning, the 17th, the impressions were:
Thy word is as precious ointment; and I had another comfortable day.
May I ever walk worthy of so great favors.

"`11th month 5th. Returned from Baltimore Yearly Meeting,
attending some meetings on the way.
The aspirations of my heart were raised in grateful
acknowledgment to the Author of all our sure mercies,
in permitting myself and dear companions to return in safety to our families;
it being a time when the cholera prevailed in Baltimore and other places.

"`6th. Attended our Monthly Meeting.
The committee of our Yearly Meeting, with whom I am classed, also attended,
and I proceeded with them to most of the Monthly Meetings
within the compass of Caln and Western Quarters.
We also attended a few meetings for worship, and having, as I apprehended,
endeavored in simplicity, through the course of the above visit,
to keep my ear open to the directions of the blessed Truth,
and carefully to attend to the right time of coming home,
I was favored with a degree of sweet peace,
for which I desire to be thankful to Him who hath all blessings in his hand.

"`26th. Having for a few days past been brought under exercise, trial, and besetment,
mental breathing was felt this morning to the God and Father of my life,
after which the consoling language was afforded:
I leave the things that are behind in the hands of a merciful Creator, and press forward;
and as thou carefully eyes thy Guide, He will be with thee, even unto the end;
and give thee an admittance into his heavenly mansion.
At which my soul was satisfied, and this language arose;
Blessed be '`the God of Jeshurum who rideth upon the heaven,
and in his excellency on the sky.`' May my soul bless thy Holy Name.

"`29th. My poor weak mind gave way to doubting again, but before I arose this morning,
condescending; goodness appeared in a consoling manner: but feeling my unworthiness,
and fearing lest it was a delusion of the evil one, these consoling words revived:
'`I am He, and there is no other.
I am the first and the last.`' Thy sins have been
washed away in the atoning blood of the Lamb.
At which my soul rejoiced,
and supplications have since ascended to the unfailing Shepherd of Israel,
that I may not be suffered to doubt again,
but continue to walk worthy of His compassionate regard.

"`12th month 10th. My dear son being about to leave us for some time,
to go to Burlington Boarding School, my mind became closely tried on various accounts;
my own unworthiness and doubts of acceptance with
the Most High and Holy One being the greatest.
Upon retiring in order to feel after the knowledge of His blessed will,
it seemed as in an instant, and as if it were spoken, Canst thou not believe?
If thou wilt not believe the evidence already afforded, thou wilt not believe anything.
At which my poor tossed mind became more calm and prostrate before the Lord,
and supplications ascended,
to be enabled to lay fast hold of the little grain of faith then afforded;
after which a comfortable change was wrought in my feelings,
which no human contrivance could have effected.
Gracious Father! may I keep near unto Thee in all my future steppings.

"`1st month 23rd, 1833.
After an absence of more than two weeks,
having been in company with most of the committee of the Yearly Meeting, I returned home,
and found my small, lonely family well; which was cause of thankfulness.
The committee visited nearly all the Preparative Meetings
belonging to Concord and Caln Quarterly Meetings,
our own being the last.
I have been sensible in the course of it, of some misses and shortcomings,
for want of closer watchfulness, but cannot charge myself with wilful disobedience;
and my gracious Master has not chastened me severely, blessed be His holy name,
but has permitted me to enjoy peaceful poverty, mostly, since my return.
May I be more watchful,
and labor to keep increasingly near unto Him who
is worthy of the dedication of my whole heart.

"`4th month 23rd. Yesterday I returned from our Yearly Meeting, which was large.
An evidence was mercifully afforded that we are not a forsaken people;
being favored from time to time with the overshadowing of divine good.
Having endeavored to attend to the pointings of Truth,
I have been favored to return with a comfortable degree of peace;
all of which I desire to commemorate with gratitude:
as also that of my family being preserved in health during my absence.

"`11th month 13th. I left home and attended the Select Preparative
and Select Quarterly Meetings to a good degree of satisfaction.
But was prevented from being at the General Meeting for Business,
by being suddenly much indisposed;
and a renewal of close scrutiny was felt respecting my inward state,
which continued until after my return last evening;
when in looking over my steppings for some years back, fears were renewedly felt,
lest some of my service, professedly religious, had been too much in the mixture,
for want of keeping sufficiently near to Divine counsel: when,
under a humbling sense thereof, it seemed spoken impressively to my inward understanding,
My mercy is greater than thy steppings aside:
at which my poor mind was again bowed in gratitude,
and a precious sense of quiet and peace has been
experienced through the course of this day;
for which unmerited favor I desire to be reverently thankful.

"`12th month 18th. Returned home after an absence of several days,
having been in company with a committee of our Monthly Meeting,
who were appointed to visit those who are remiss
in the attendance of our religious meetings.
The service, as it was proceeded in, was attended with a good degree of satisfaction,
my mind being renewedly impressed with a sense that it is
only as we endeavor to keep near to Divine guidance,
that such visits can be rightly performed.

"`In First month, 1834, the visit above alluded to was finished;
and the committee feel an encouraging hope that some usefulness may result therefrom.

"`8th month 1834.
Having attended our Quarterly Meeting,
and being sensible that many weaknesses remain among us,
a little ability was afforded to labor on account thereof, for which I feel peace;
and a desire arises that I may be increasingly concerned to keep on the watch-tower.

"`8th month 24th. Feeling this morning a degree of solemnity to cover my mind,
in which I am renewedly made sensible, that,
if I have attained to any degree of standing in the blessed Truth,
it has not been through any merit of my own,
but by the grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord,
by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost:
an increase of which I humbly crave.

"`2nd month 1835.
I attended our Quarterly Meeting under a sense that it is a low time,
and more humility and fervent religious zeal appear to me to be much wanting among us.

"`4th month 12th. Visited two persons under affliction.
I was led into sympathy with them, particularly the young man, who is a member with us,
of orderly conduct, and somewhat useful in Society; yet now on a sick-bed,
he seems sensible that he has slighted many offered mercies, and feels as one cast off;
but was favored to supplicate the most holy One for forgiveness.
It felt to me an humbling time; and the language of encouragement flowed toward him,
in an unshaken belief that He who hath thus afflicted,
and for a small moment forsaken him,
will in His own time return with everlasting kindness,
give him the oil of joy for mourning,
and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
I returned home under a thankful sense of having obtained a little bread in my own house,
and ability was mercifully afforded to lie down as beside the still waters.

"`4th month 25th. Returned from our Yearly Meeting which was large.
By the reports from the different Quarterly Meetings,
it is evident deficiencies still remain among us;
but ability was mercifully afforded to many exercised sisters,
to labor for their removal,
and I thought the condescending goodness of Israel`'s Shepherd
was mercifully near in most or all of the sittings;
which is cause of humble thankfulness.

"`8th month 5th. Returned home after attending our Monthly Meeting at Sadsbury yesterday.
I went under considerable discouragement, partly on account of indisposition.
It is a time when there are many causes for exercise;
and the necessity of laboring to keep near to the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
was renewedly felt in an impressive manner.
And although no way opened for relief of mind, through the medium of vocal expression,
yet blessed be the name of Israel`'s Shepherd,
I have been permitted to return in the feeling of comfortable quiet.
Oh! may I never take up a rest short of the true rest; which I sometimes fear.

"`9th. Attended our Quarterly Meeting,
which was to me more lively than some preceding ones.
On returning, went a little out of my way to see an aged woman Friend,
who gets but little to meeting.
I have long thought that it was the duty of those who are able to move about,
to visit those who are confined at home,
and much deprived of the opportunity of getting to religious meetings.

"`10th month 3rd. I met the committee at Westtown,
and attended the morning and afternoon meetings: also our Monthly Meeting on my return;
and visited a Friend, who through age and loss of sight,
has been confined at home for some years.
Although sensible of some omissions in the course of this little journey,
yet believe I may say of a truth, it was more through a fear of being too forward,
or of not having received sufficient commission, than wilful disobedience;
and through the mercy of our compassionate Redeemer,
I was favored to return with a comfortable degree of peaceful quiet,
surpassing my desert.

"`11th month 9th. Being indisposed for several days past,
and at the same time exercised before the Most High,
in desire to know His blessed will respecting some
impressions which had been made on my mind,
and whether the performance of the duty was required,
after a time of conflict and besetment, I trust a good degree of resignation was felt,
and comfortable quiet experienced,
in which I remembered that it was said unto David the Psalmist,
when he was about to build an house unto the Lord:--
'`thou didst well that it was in thine heart:`'
upon which my exercise became relieved, at least for the present.
But having renewedly seen, I think, that my standing is as on a sea of glass,
desires have been raised that I may be enabled to keep near to holy help,
that neither self, my great enemy, nor any other foe,
may be permitted to retard my progress heavenward.
Lord help me onward, I beseech Thee!`"

No date.
"`Being again exercised respecting the foregoing subject,
which was to visit a man in Lancaster prison,
I was greatly beset with various discouragements, such as my own unfitness;
having no acquaintance with the prisoner;
and such a visit from a female being altogether new in Lancaster, as far as I knew.
Yet the exercise pressing heavily upon me, I ventured to open it to a few Friends,
who did not discourage me;
and the necessary care being taken to open the way for the visit,
it was performed on the 21st of the Eleventh month,
accompanied by my dear friends William Kirkwood and Lydia Brinton.
It was a season not soon to be forgotten.
The fear of man being taken from me,
I was enabled to feel deeply for the poor transgressor,
and to relieve my mind of the burden;
for which I trust I feel a degree of humble thankfulness to Him
who is still pleased to manifest Himself to be strength in weakness;
and blessed be his Holy Name.
He continues, I believe beyond all doubt, to be the friend of sinners.

"`6th month, 1836.
It has been a very low season with me for some time past, and a close searching of heart,
attended with the query, Why is it so?
Has the world, and the things of the world, again too much taken hold of my mind;
and with David the Psalmist shall I exclaim,
'`Are His mercies clean gone forever?`' But this morning my heart is raised
in desire that I may be made acceptable in the Divine sight.
'`Let not thine hand spare, nor thine eye pity,
until thou hast made of me what thou wouldst have
me to be.`' Eradicate every secret fault,
that so I may be prepared, through the efficacy of Thy power and mercy,
when the solemn closing moments come, to receive the clean linen, pure and white,
the righteousness of saints.

"`9th month 13th. In looking over the leaves of my life, now in the 66th year of my age,
I am sensible that the enemy of my soul`'s peace, and of all righteousness,
has often closely beset me, as on every side, with temptations, doubts, and fears,
and plausible accusations,
which have been as the blast of the terrible one beating against the wall.
Yet blessed be the name of the Lord,
He remains to be a strong tower to those who seek Him for refuge in the day of trouble.
I was comforted today in meeting with the revival of the following passage of Holy Writ,
'`Behold I have graven thee on the palms of my hands;
thy walls are continually before me:`' since which I have been
preserved in a good degree of peaceful quiet,--a great favor.

"`10th month 10th, 1836.
Though sensible of many departures from the right way,
for want of keeping near to unmixed good at times,
and at others from a fear of putting my hand to the work unbidden,
more than from wilful disobedience, prayers have ascended to the Father of mercies,
that He may be pleased to pass by all my omissions and commissions,
and that which has been too much in the mixture,
and enable me to walk more consistent with the gospel of His dear Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord,--being fully sensible that
any efforts to promote his righteous cause,
unaided by Him, will be fruitless and unavailing.

"`11th. After penning the foregoing yesterday,
my mind was preserved in a good degree of quiet, and this morning it was given me to see,
I trust by the unfailing Shepherd of Israel,
that such seasons of sifting and proving were needful for me,
and that my past departures would not be treasured up against me;
that if I carefully eyed the light of our blessed Leader,
He would not suffer my feet to slide, but would preserve me even unto the end,
and finally give me an admittance into His heavenly kingdom,
where the morning stars sing together, and all the sons of God shout for joy.
I write with the feeling of solemnity.
May my soul bless Thy holy name, O Lord,
and may I never be permitted to cast away my confidence in Thee,
thou unfailing Helper of all those who put their trust in Thee.

"`11th month 17th and 18th. I attended our Quarterly Meeting,
where we had the company of several Friends from a neighboring Quarter,
which to me was very satisfactory.
'`As iron sharpeneth iron,
so doth the countenance of a man his friend.`' On the evening of the 18th,
I visited a family which had recently been deprived of its female head by death.
She was a beloved Friend, and the language of my mind was on the occasion,
Though she be dead, she yet speaketh.
Follow her as she followed Christ.
I was well satisfied in mingling a little in feeling with the bereaved relatives.

"`19th. Myself and two children attended a meeting at Downingtown
appointed by my dear cousin Sarah Emlen and companions.
She was favored in testimony and in supplication,
and I thought the meeting closed under a sense of renewed favor.
Having endeavored to keep my ear open to the discipline of the cross from day to day,
I was favored to return with peaceful feelings.

"`After having experienced much conflict of mind in the
prospect of visiting the families of our Monthly Meeting,
and the time appearing to have come to open it to my friends,
I accordingly yielded thereto in our Monthly Meeting held 3rd of 1st month, 1837.
Obtaining the approbation of the meeting,
and some Friends being appointed to accompany me, to wit: Truman Cooper, Mary Evans,
and Lydia Coale, Friends to whom I feel nearly united,
three of us set out on the visit on the First-day following,
being the 8th of First month, and visited the families of Sadsbury Preparative Meeting.
They were about forty-six in number, including some which have individual members in them.
Being somewhat indisposed I returned home peacefully on the evening of the 18th,
and remained there until the 30th,
when we resumed the service of visiting the families and members of Lampeter,
including those which remain at Columbia--in all, ten families, with some individuals;
and may say of a truth that I often felt encompassed with weakness and fear,
feeling that of myself I could do nothing;
but having endeavored to keep my eye single to our Holy Leader, I can say,
now the service is closed, that He who I believe put forth, was pleased to go before,
and has condescended to give me a precious reward;
for which I desire to bless his Holy Name,
being sensible that I am but an unprofitable servant.

"`2nd month 17th. Attended our Quarterly Meeting, which was a time of exercise.
The eight queries were answered preparatory to sending
a report to our ensuing Yearly Meeting.
I often feel in these meetings that the weight rests comparatively on a few;
and the language sometimes arises, '`Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest,
that he would send forth more laborers into his harvest.`'

"`4th month 5th. This morning is the time the Westtown school committee meet,
and I would have gladly met with them if it had been convenient.
But my place seemed to be at home;
though a place where I am feeling lonely on account
of the absence of my dear daughter A.,
who having accomplished her marriage with Samuel Rhoads, Jr., the 15th of last month,
left the home of her childhood on the 3rd instant,
to settle with her husband at Blockley, near Philadelphia.
It has been a close bereavement to me,
feeling like to breaking a link of the chain which bound
myself and dear children together in near affection;
yet have been comforted in the hope that she is in her right place, and that,
as they are concerned to keep near to the blessed Truth,
they will be true helpmates to each other, and be made useful in their day;
which is my earnest desire for them.

"`4th month I attended our Yearly Meeting.
It was large, and a few Friends from other Yearly Meetings on this continent,
were in attendance.
I thought it was a time of renewed favor, and cause of thankfulness, notwithstanding,
by the reports from the different quarters, deficiencies still remain amongst us,
yet a lively travail and exercise was experienced for the removal.
I went to see my son-in-law and daughter, in their new home at Haddington,
for the first time.
It was a satisfactory visit, and I returned home on the 22nd of the month,
and found my dear children and family well;
for which I desire to be thankful to the Author of all our blessings.`"

No date.
"`For some time past my mind has been tossed with doubts and fears,
lest my ways were not in accordance with the Divine Will;
and in our meeting last Fourth-day, 19th of Seventh month,
my mind was clothed with desires for myself and the little company assembled,
that we might in every season of conflict and trial,
be kept so near to the blessed Master, that He may be pleased to sanctify them unto us,
and our lives be made more consistent with the gospel of His dear Son,
Christ Jesus our Lord.
My feelings were brought into tenderness,
and the expression of the exercise seemed required in vocal supplication;
after which I was favored with a comfortable calm; which has been continued mostly since,
under an humble trust, that He who hath been with me,
still regards me with a compassionate eye.
May I be sufficiently thankful for this and every other favor.

"`8th month 7th. Having been exercised at times for the
spiritual welfare of those of our own neighborhood,
particularly such as are not members of our religious Society:
and after distributing some religious tracts where I felt drawn to do so,
and feeling my mind clothed with the spirit of supplication for them,
as well as for all the human family,
I was relieved on their account at least for the present.
Being renewedly clothed with desires on my own account that nothing might be left undone;
which ought to be done, while time and opportunity are afforded,
being led into a close scrutiny respecting my own state of acceptance
in the sight of Him who is judge of the whole earth,
and not finding that anything is charged against me, this language arose,
Cast thy care on Him who careth for thee, and as thou carefully eyes his requirings,
thy way will be made prosperous; which cheered my drooping spirit,
and produced a comfortable quiet.
The language now arises, O Lord, my only Helper, be pleased to keep me near unto thyself.
Condescend, I pray thee, to be my stay and my staff,
and rock of defence against all the wiles of an unwearied enemy,
and after every season of conflict and trial, enable me, if it be Thy blessed will,
to sing thy praise as on banks of heartfelt deliverance.

"`27th. This day in our meeting, I was favored, in an unusual degree, with Heavenly love,
and I was ready to conclude it was more generally experienced than usual, in silence.
Indeed, I thought I could adopt the language:
'`My joy no man taketh from me.`' Gracious Father! my times are in thy hands,
and it is of thy mercy that I am not consumed.
Keep me, I pray thee, in heights and in depths.
Suffer neither things present nor things to come to separate
me from the love of Thee in Christ Jesus our Lord.

"`9th month 5th. Our Monthly Meeting day.
I left home under much exercise, in order to meet with the Westtown school committee.
Visited dear Lydia Ann Buffington at her request,
which was a comfortable opportunity to me, and proved to be a closing one,
as she deceased before I returned home.
We reached Westtown that evening,
and it was somewhat strengthening to my mind to meet with my dear friends there.
I attended the committee next morning.

"`2nd month 9th, 1838.
After earnest desires for right direction and preservation, with the appeal, O Father,
be pleased to help me onward in the way thou wouldst have me to go,
my thoughts were turned towards a poor man who is in Lancaster prison,
charged with the crime of murder, and under sentence of death therefor.
And the exercise increasing, I was made willing to yield to the prospect of visiting him.
My friends not discouraging me,
and the necessary preparation being made for such a visit,
accompanied by my dear friends William Kirkwood and Mary Evans, we visited the prisoner,
who appeared to be under strong conviction.
My heart was engaged in earnest desire that he might be
brought to a sense of the exceeding sinfulness of sin,
and by the cleansing powerful operations of Divine grace,
be restored to the favor of an offended but merciful Creator.
For this service I was favored with the reward of peace,
for which I desire to be thankful to Him who alone can give it.

"`4th month 5th. I went to Westtown and attended the committee there as usual.
There was much to exercise it, and the prevailing desire was,
that the concern may be wholly conducted under the guidance of the blessed Truth.
From there I went to Chester, to visit my sisters S. Eyre and L. Pusey.
It was a satisfactory time to me, and I parted with them in tender affection.
Having endeavored in simplicity to attend to some little intimations of apprehended duty,
the language of my heart was, '`Great peace have they who keep thy law,
and nothing shall offend them.`' From Chester I went to Philadelphia,
and attended our Yearly Meeting.
It was a time of much exercise and close proving to many in our Society, who, I believe,
are wearing sackcloth underneath.
Yet through unmerited mercy, the meeting closed under a sense of Heavenly good;
and I returned to my family on Seventh-day, the 21st,
and found them in pretty good health,
which is cause of thankfulness to the Author of all our blessings.

"`5th month 17th, 1838.
I attended our Quarterly Meeting.
It was a time of close exercise, there being many causes for it.
The following week I went to the Western Quarterly Meeting,
which was more satisfactory to me.
After which, my son being with me, we visited some of our near relations,
I trust to mutual satisfaction.
Among others called to see my dear afflicted friend A. S.,
who has been suffering with a cancer for many years.
Her daughter and only child, A. C., is also in feeble health,
her spine being affected so that she can nurse her infant very little.
It was a satisfaction to me to be with them,
and witness their patient cheerful resignation under suffering;
feeling tender sympathy with them.

"`6th month 22nd. I am now in the sixty-eighth year of my age; and trials still await me.
Desires were raised this morn, that neither heights nor depths,
things present nor to come,
may be able to separate me from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord:
and O that I may be kept in the path of his holy commandment.

"`7th month 8th. Last Third-day our Monthly Meeting was held;
and soon after we assembled, I thought a comfortable solemnity prevailed:
under which our two valued friends +++_______+++ and +++_______+++ had something
to offer in a ministerial line,
and the first meeting closed in supplication.
It seemed to me a time of renewed favor.
The business of the meeting for discipline being gotten through satisfactorily,
I came home peaceful.

"`29th. For some time past it has been a season of trial and exercise, and as it were,
toiling all night and catching nothing.
The language of my heart often was, '`My leanness, my leanness,
woe unto me!`' fearing the light which had been graciously afforded
from season to season was becoming darkness in me.
But through unmerited mercy, my mind became this day in our meeting,
clothed with the spirit of supplication, that we might be made,
through the baptismal influence of the Holy Ghost and fire,
more conformable to the gospel of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ;
and that the dear youth might be enamored with his love,
and given to see increasingly the beauty there is in holiness,
and the excellency of a possession in the unchangeable Truth.
I returned peacefully from meeting, for which unmerited favor,
I think I do feel thankful to Him who hath all blessings at His disposal.
Oh! that He may be pleased from time to time, to cast down the accuser of the brethren,
him who was a liar from the beginning.

"`8th month 16th and 17th. Attended our Quarterly Meeting.
It was to me a dull low time, and I returned in poverty of spirit.
Gracious Father! be pleased to keep me patient,
steadily looking unto Thee with an eye of faith.
And oh that Thou may`'st be pleased not to forsake me nor be far from me.

"`9th,
month 18th. Today there seems a probability that
I may be restored to my usual health again,
after a severe bilious attack, which was attended with acute suffering for nearly a week.
In the prospect of returning health,
my desire is to be engaged the few remaining days that may be allotted me,
so as to be prepared for the clean linen, pure and white,
which is the righteousness of saints.
It hath renewedly appeared to me this morning,
that those who are engaged in the Lamb`'s warfare,
have many seasons of conflict and close proving to pass through:
in which I have remembered the woman spoken of in Revelations,
who was clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet,
being followed by the great red dragon; and how marvellously she was helped,
by the earth opening and swallowing up the floods which
were cast out of his mouth in order to destroy her.
I renewedly believe that those who are endeavoring in sincerity
to be members of the true church in the present day,
will experience, from season to season,
that the power of the High and Holy One is over the
power of the subtle enemy in all his devices:
and that He who can alone bruise the serpent`'s head,
will in His own time put the armies of the aliens to flight,
and enable his suppliant seed to journey forward in the line of Divine appointment.

"`10th month 7th. This evening feeling my mind drawn
into silence and waiting before the Most High,
a precious covering was experienced,
insomuch that a query arose whether I was not shortly
to be released from the toils and troubles of life,
being permitted to feel an unusual degree of sweetness and solemnity for some time.
I was humbled under a sense of my own unworthiness,
and that these seasons of favor and refreshment are not at our command.
Gracious Father! be pleased, I pray Thee, to keep me in heights and in depths,
that I may not take my flight in the winter season, neither on the Sabbath day.

"`2nd month 1839.
I attended our Quarterly Meeting under considerable bodily infirmity,
yet was not quite easy to stay at home.
I was well satisfied with going,
though thought I was sensible of the need we have as a Society of more inwardness,
weightiness of spirit, and consistent walking with our high and holy profession.

"`3rd month 3rd. Our beloved friends William and Joseph Evans,
in the course of their religious visit to the meetings of our Quarterly Meeting,
attended ours.
Their company, and William`'s gospel labors were comforting,
and I doubt not encouraging to the little flock.
Indeed it seemed to me a '`brook by the way.`' They also attended our Monthly Meeting.

"`10th. Under considerable exercise of mind, with desires for a little spiritual bread,
if not altogether unworthy.
Forever blessed be the name of Israel`'s Shepherd,
He was pleased to pour forth the spirit of supplication, which was vocally offered,
that He would anoint our eyes with the eye-salve of His kingdom,
that so we may be enabled not only to see men as trees walking,
but that we might see in the clearness His blessed will concerning us,
and be furnished with strength to perform it.
Since which my mind has been preserved in a good degree of peaceful quiet,
much out of the way of the destroyer, at least for the present.
Gracious Father, be pleased to keep me near unto Thyself,
and suffer me not to cast away my confidence in Thee.

"`5th month I attended our Quarterly Meeting,
which I thought was more lively than some preceding ones.
Our dear friends William Evans and David Cope were there,
and were both favored in testimony;
and the meeting for worship closed under a sense of renewed favor.
The meeting for discipline was also satisfactory,
and I returned home with feelings of peaceful quiet,
which I desire to commemorate with gratitude.

"`6th month 8th. After having passed several days of trial, proving, and close besetment,
this morning my mind became unexpectedly impressed with the remembrance
of many past seasons of proving and temptation which have been permitted;
and that it was nothing short of the goodness of the Most High,
that has raised me again and again out of them; and a sense seemed given me,
that I was still under his notice,
attended with a precious feeling of gratitude and thanksgiving.
In a few days after I was renewedly impressed with a belief,
that the light in me had not become darkness: which were favors indeed,
having sometimes feared that I was as the withered branch,
or as the salt that had lost its savor.

"`14th. Our dear friend Elizabeth Pitfield,
and her companions E. P. and C. A. in the course of their
visit to the meetings of Caln and Western Quarters,
attended ours: which with their visit to our house, was much to my satisfaction.
A little time of quiet took place in the evening,
and dear E. P. having something to communicate in the line of the ministry,
it proved a season of strengthening to my often tried mind,
and was cause of humble gratitude to the Author of all our blessings.
Oh that I may not be an ungrateful receiver!

"`7th month. My mind being renewedly impressed with a concern
which has attended it at times for several years,
and particularly about the time of harvest,
to appoint a meeting in our meetinghouse on a First-day
afternoon for the laboring class of people,
more especially for those who were employed by Friends;
and such others as did not often attend any place of worship,
and there being a number of the latter class, I apprehended,
collected about our neighboring village of Enterprise on First-day,
I seemed much drawn to them.
Feeling the subject weighty,
and believing the time had come for me to mention it to my Friends, I did so,
though much in the cross to my own will.
They left me at liberty, and the necessary care being taken,
the meeting was held on the 21st instant; and though it was small,
was satisfying and relieving to me,
believing I had endeavored to keep near to the pointings of the blessed Truth.

"`2nd month 4th. 1840.
In the fall of 1839, my mind became closely exercised at times,
on account of visiting a young man who was in Lancaster prison,
charged with the crime of murder, and was under sentence of death.
He is a German, and is said not to have been long in America,
and that he is in a very hardened state.
I had many conflicts, doubts, and fears on the occasion,
lest I might go forth without being sent; but after a time of trial,
I apprehended the language was sufficiently clear to my spiritual understanding,
'`Go and I will go with thee.`' I therefore consulted
a few friends who did not discourage me,
and my dear friends William Kirkwood and Lydia Brinton being willing to accompany me,
we accordingly went early in the Twelfth month.
The sheriff having been previously made acquainted with our prospect,
was consenting thereto.
Very soon after being introduced into the prisoner`'s apartment,
a comfortable solemnity was felt to prevail,
and we were made thankful in believing that goodness and mercy was still offered,
in adorable condescension, to the poor erring creature, and after endeavoring faithfully,
to deliver what arose pressingly in my mind, I was favored to return home,
truly thankful that I had yielded to the prospect:
being permitted to experience a portion of that peace
which the world can neither give nor take away.`"

No date.
"`My dear daughter and son are now gone to our Monthly Meeting at Sadsbury;
my infirmity of body being such it did not seem best I should go:
the weather being also very cold.
My mind is often with Friends,
in desire that the business may be transacted according to the blessed Truth:
that the elder class may be strengthened, the middle aged animated,
and the precious youth encouraged to do what their hands find to do.

"`In the winter of 1840, perhaps in the Second month, our dear friend Jacob Green,
from Ireland, in the course of his religious visit in this land,
was at our meeting and at this house.
His sympathy and religious labors in our family were truly comforting and edifying.
His company and gospel labors at our meeting were also truly acceptable.
Oh! that these renewed favors may be treasured up, and not be let fall to the ground.

"`3rd month 1840.
I attended the committee at Westtown.
My feelings were renewedly interested in the concerns there,
and in being in company with the dear children.
May our Heavenly Father condescend more and more to bless that part of his heritage,
so that sons and daughters may be raised up from among them to His honor.

"`4th month 17th. I went to Philadelphia to attend our Yearly Meeting.
It was large; and although some of us went in fear,
lest a dividing spirit should be apparent,
yet there was cause for thankfulness to the Author of all good,
in that the meeting was so kept that Friends were favored
to transact the business of it in a good degree of harmony;
and I thought it was evident that the great I Am was near,
for the help and strength of His little ones.
May these still confide in Him.
It being the time for the Westtown school committee to be changed,
my name was left off at my request, feeling as I apprehended, released from the service.

"`11th month 4th. It having been a time of much strippedness and poverty with me,
the aspirations of my heart have often been to the Most High,
'`Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth,
and be pleased to keep me steadily looking unto thee the
Author and Finisher of the saints`' faith.`'

"`1st month 17th, 1841.`"
Our dear friend alludes under this date to an arrangement
for her and her dear children to leave their place of abode,
where she had resided more than thirty-nine years.
She dwells feelingly upon the prospect of being separated from dear friends,
to some of whom she was united in the bonds of gospel fellowship,
to go among those who were comparative strangers to her;
but expresses the desire to be where and what she ought to be;
and concludes with the appealing language: "`Oh! most Holy Father,
be pleased to preserve from the assaults of the enemy,
be pleased to bruise his head from time to time.
Suffer neither heights, nor depths, I beseech thee, things present nor things to come,
to separate us from the love of Thee in Christ Jesus our Lord.`"

"`2nd month 14th,`" she writes, "`Our dear friend H. W., Jr.,
with her companions R. R. and N. N. S.,
attended our meeting today in the course of their religious visit in these parts:
and H. was favored to hand forth counsel and encouragement
to both the aged and the beloved youth.
May we profit by it.
Last week I attended our Quarterly Meeting at Caln.
The causes for exercise were many and various,
yet the great and good Helper was pleased to afford a little
ability to labor for the healing of the breaches,
and the restoring of paths to walk in;
and I am favored to feel a portion of that quiet which is precious.`"

"`The Lord`'s mercies are declared to be new every morning; and one of these is,
His remembrance of those, the poor in spirit, whose petitions are often unto Him,
'`Give us day by day our daily bread;`' so that these are
enabled from time to time to set up Ebenezers to His name,
with the acknowledgment, '`Hitherto He hath helped;`' and thus to put on fresh strength,
through the life and power of his Holy Spirit,
and to press towards the mark for the prize of our high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
These also know that salvation is not the work of a day, or any mushroom growth;
but to be wrought out through the obedience which is of faith,
and perseverance in the straight and narrow way, like the husbandman in the parable,
who '`waiteth for the precious fruits of the earth, and hath long patience for it,
until he receive the early and latter rain.`'
O! for more faithful walkers in the good old way
of the footsteps of the flock of Christ`'s companions,
after the power of an endless life:
remembering the precepts--never more needed--'`Fight the good fight of faith.`'
'`Looking diligently lest any man fail of (or fall from) the grace of God.`'
'`In your patience possess ye your souls.`'

"`28th. After a time of close proving and doubts
respecting my state of acceptance in the Divine sight,
and future well-being,
a little I trust of the calming influence of Divine Good clothed my mind,
wherein an evidence was afforded, as at some other times,
that my past departures from the right way of the Lord were passed by,
and remembered no more.
Holy Father, be pleased to keep me in faith and patience, even unto the end.
Grant me, I pray thee,
an admittance into the assembly of the just of all
generations when time to me shall be no more.

"`3rd month 6th. Our dear friend Christopher Healy
had an appointed meeting at three o`'clock today,
at our meetinghouse, for all classes of people.
It was a stormy afternoon, yet a considerable number attended.
I thought Christopher was favored to open the doctrines of our Society with clearness,
and I hope it was a profitable season to many.

"`8th. The time for leaving our present abode is drawing near,
causing much thoughtfulness and exercise.
A deep scrutiny on my own account has been felt, whereby I was almost overwhelmed.
But feeling desirous yesterday morning, yea craving,
to be favored with a little strength more than my own,
and retiring to my chamber with my mind turned inward to the Lord,
after a time of waiting,
a consoling season was afforded which has reminded me of
that when our blessed Lord rebuked the winds and the sea,
so that there was a great calm.
I have been mercifully sustained since in quiet trust.
Holy Father!
Thou who art strength in our weakness,
be pleased to guide and keep me even unto the end of my pilgrimage,
and not suffer the enemy of all righteousness to come in as a flood.
For Thou alone art able to cast him down.

"`4th month 10th. My dear daughter J. and myself
came to S. Rhoads`' in order to reside for a time.
It was a close trial to leave my former comfortable home, but I was sustained under it.

"`Not long after a concern revived with me, which, for several years,
at times had presented with some clearness; and now believing the time had come,
I opened to my friends the prospect of visiting the
meetings composing the Western Quarterly Meeting.`"

[.offset]
+++[+++This visit was performed with her friends Truman Cooper and Mary Evans for companions,
and under date of 6th month 8th, she writes:]

"`I attended our Monthly Meeting,
and returned the minute which was granted me last month,
with information that the service had been performed
to the relief and satisfaction of my own mind.
Afterward, with my dear son and daughter A.,
visited some of my friends and relations of Lampeter.
It was a close trial to leave them again,
having been bound to them by the ties of natural affection,
and to some of them I trust in the bonds of gospel fellowship.
Having parted with my kind brother-in-law Abraham Gibbons, this afternoon,
who has been here on a visit, I feel stripped and tried.
Oh Lord, be pleased to support me.
'`Cast me not off in the time of old age:
forsake me not when my strength faileth,`' being now in the 71st year of my age.

"`10th month 13th. Left home in order to attend my son`'s marriage,
which was accomplished next day at Friends`' meeting at Fallowfield.
It was to me a dull, low time as to the life of religion.
From there I went to Sadsbury,
and attended to an appointment I was under from our Select Preparative Meeting.

"`17th. Attended Bart Meeting to my satisfaction, where my nephew R. G. met me,
and I went with him to his father`'s that evening.

"`My mind being exercised on account of our remaining so
long within the compass of Darby Meeting without certificates,
with the prevailing hope at times that if it was right,
way might open for our return to Lampeter,
and endeavoring to weigh the subject carefully while there, as well as at other seasons,
the prospect of returning seeming attended with increased difficulty,
I saw no better way at present,
than to request a certificate for myself and daughter J. to Darby Monthly Meeting.
This I did at our Monthly Meeting at Lampeter, the 2nd of Eleventh month.
It was a time of close exercise with me on several accounts,
having left my dear sister Susanna Eyre in poor health,
and feeling desirous to be released from other concerns that I might be more with her:
but to my great trial of mind, she was taken suddenly more ill,
and was removed by death in my absence.
My mind still feeling bound to a concern which had often exercised it,
I did not feel at liberty to leave Lampeter, until I had made an effort at least,
to see some in that neighborhood,
who had been long in the practice of taking strong drink to excess;
and in company with my brother, Abraham Gibbons, we went to the houses of two of them,
and also took an opportunity with a young man who keeps a public house,
and who I apprehend was in the practice of selling
spirituous liquor to the injury of his fellow men.
Although I did not get to see as many of the class alluded to as I desired,
they not being at home, yet having endeavored to do what I could,
I was favored to return peacefully,
and thankful that I had attended to the humiliating service as far as way opened,
and nothing appeared but that the visit was well received.

"`11th month 1841.
After leaving Lampeter,
I spent a few days with my dear sister Lydia Pusey in Philadelphia,
who was about to leave the habitation of our dear departed sister Susanna Eyre,
and return to Chester.
It felt to me a solemn time; and desires were raised for preservation and right direction.
Soon after my return to my present home,
I became afflicted with a severe pain in my head, and a discharge from one ear,
which the doctor said was erysipelas internally.
It was a closely proving time, being much stripped and tried with poverty of spirit:
yet a little gleam of hope was from time to time afforded, that I was not cut off;
and soon after I was able to get out again,
I felt an engagement of mind to visit a family who were under affliction.
But not being much acquainted with them, it was yielded to in the cross,
feeling indeed as a little child; but endeavoring to keep near to the exercise,
was favored to return with the reward of peace.`"

+++[+++The acknowledgment by Hannah Gibbons in the foregoing memorandum of '`poverty
of spirit,`' with but '`a little gleam of hope from time to time afforded;`'
and also a prospect of duty required of her '`being much in the cross,
feeling indeed as a little child,`' clearly represents
that her experience in the school of Christ,
and the good old way of life and salvation, was, in the power of the cross,
through many and sore baptisms, which tended to humble self,
and to bring into the little child`'s state;
whereby only the will of the Lord can be ascertained and done,
and the kingdom of heaven entered.
O! the preciousness of being brought low, and meekened by Him who alone can give life,
and of being under that holy chastening discipline, which,
through great tribulations and being washed in the blood of the Lamb,
makes sure at last the ever blessed promise--to be led unto living fountains of waters,
where God shall wipe away all tears from the eyes.]

'''

"`1st month 30th, 1842.
This day at meeting a little ability was afforded to relieve my mind in testimony,
and I was strengthened also to supplicate vocally for continued mercies.
In the afternoon visited a sick child.
The day closed peacefully.

"`4th month. My head continued in a weak state through the winter;
so that I was not always able to get to meeting.
But this month I attended our Yearly Meeting, and being much deprived of my hearing,
was not able to enter so minutely into the concerns of it as I might otherwise have done.
But I felt a degree of resignation to my situation,
attended with desires that it might be a means of keeping
my inward ear more attentive to Divine instruction.
The meeting was, I thought, a season of renewed favor,
inasmuch as the Great Head of the church condescended to be with His little ones,
and qualify them for His work and service.
Yet many causes for exercise remain within our borders.

"`A prospect of religious service which had for years at
times impressed my mind to visit some meetings in New Jersey,
now reviving with increasing weight; and the Quarterly Meeting of Salem,
with the meetings constituting it, appearing with so much clearness,
I thought the time had come to open it to my Friends.
Accordingly I did so at our Monthly Meeting,
and my beloved friends Jane and Edward Garrett expressed a willingness to accompany me.

"`We left home 5th month 1st, under feelings, as respects myself, of great self-abasement.
But to the praise of the great Name be it spoken, when He puts forth He goeth before.
Thus a little ability was afforded to relieve my mind from meeting to meeting,
as well as some precious opportunities in sick chambers
which we met with in the course of the visit.
The service closed peacefully, in time for us to attend our own Quarterly Meeting.
The favor of being enabled to perform that which
I apprehended to be the requiring of my Divine Master,
to the relief and satisfaction of my own mind,
I desire to ascribe unto Him to whom it belongs.

"`In the Sixth month I went to see my son and his wife at Coatesville,
the first time since they were married.
How I crave for them that they may seek first the
kingdom of Heaven and the righteousness thereof.
Oh Holy Father! be pleased not to forsake them,
but in thy mercy give them to feel the unsatisfying nature of all sublunary things;
and that in Thee alone there is substantial joy.
Having a suitable opportunity,
I went from Coatesville to Londongrove on a visit to my near and dear relatives;
and was at the late dwelling of my worthy cousin Isaac Pusey,
who has recently been removed by death.
This was formerly the residence of my dear deceased Father, and the place of my nativity.
Oh the changes that have taken place in the course of my pilgrimage!

"`7th month 17th. For some time past great poverty and strippedness have been my portion.
Mine eyes are indeed ready to fail with looking upwards.
It has been a time of close scrutiny into the state of my own heart, with the query,
What am I loving most?
Gracious Father, be pleased to keep me in faith and patience,
and not suffer me to take my flight in the winter season.

"`8th month 1st. I attended the Quarterly Meeting in Philadelphia.
It is a time in our Society,
wherein there is much cause for exercise to the living members.
I believe there is a spirit at work,
which would draw some away from the spirituality of that which they have once known,
and many seem caught with it.
Gracious Father, be pleased to keep thy little ones near unto thyself,
and dependent on thy counsel inwardly revealed.

"`8th month.
I attended the Quarterly Meeting at Concord to a good degree of satisfaction;
and on my way home stopped at my dear friend Jane Garrett`'s.
Next day she accompanied me to see two friends under affliction.
One was a widow, for whom I felt tender sympathy;
and I trust we were brought near to each other, though outwardly strangers.

"`9th month. I went with my children to visit some young friends, our neighbors,
in a social way.
There we unexpectedly met with a young man for whom I have felt much, he having been,
a few months since, bereaved of a beloved wife, and thus left with three small children:
he himself being ill at the time of her death.
His mind seems much drawn from worldly pursuits; and I trust as faith,
patience and obedience are kept to,
the present afflictive dispensation will be sanctified to him.
I had an opportunity of expressing what I felt for him,
which he appeared to receive well; and I felt the reward of peace.`"

+++[+++Hannah Gibbons seems often to have been called, in the authority of the anointing,
to visit the bereaved, the sick, and the imprisoned.
And we have no doubt that He whose mercies fail not,
but are over all the workmanship of His hands,
was pleased to bless with increase the labor of His handmaiden;
verifying in her experience the language,
"`Inasmuch as ye have done (this) unto one of the least of these my brethren,
ye have done it unto me;`" and also the promise: "`The liberal soul shall be made fat:
and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.`"]

'''

No date.
"`Being often brought under exercise,
lest the present place of my abode is not the right one for me,
and desiring best direction, the language of my mind at seasons is, Gracious Father,
be pleased to manifest in Thine own time the knowledge of thy blessed will,
and give strength to perform it.

"`10th month.
I visited my friends at Coatesville and Lampeter.
While we (my daughter J. accompanied me) were at the latter place,
I felt a renewal of exercise on account of a few individuals,
who long had been careless of their best interests and whom
I had endeavored to see when I was there before,
but was prevented by their absence from home.
The exercise so increased that it seemed best to endeavor again to see them,
and finding they were then at home,
a visit was made to two individuals in their separate dwellings,
which appeared to be acceptable to the visited, and very relieving to me;
which together with our safe return, after an absence of two weeks,
is cause of gratitude.

"`10th month, 31st. In company with my son-in-law Samuel Rhoads,
I attended the funeral of a neighbor, a descendant of Friends.
His death being sudden, the occasion of our meeting together felt solemn.
I ventured, though among strangers, to express the desire I felt for the bereaved family,
that the afflictive dispensation might be sanctified to them.
And though I was careful to keep near to divine intimation,
yet fear and a care now arises, lest I should at any time express,
professedly in the name of the Most High, that which He has not spoken.
Heavenly Father,
be pleased to preserve me from kindling a fire and warming myself by the sparks thereof,
lest I should have to lie down in sorrow;
being sensible my standing is as on a sea of glass.

"`11th month.
I attended, in company with my daughter J., the Quarterly Meeting at Caln,
of which I was long a member.
It was much to my satisfaction, being favored, I trust, with a renewal of that love,
which binds the household of faith together, and strengthens the humble traveller.
In the afternoon of Fifth-day I went to see an afflicted
friend (Israel Doan) who has recently lost his eyesight.
His mind seemed humbled under the affliction, and desirous of being resigned thereto.
I was glad I went, though the afternoon was very wet.
I do believe it among right things to remember the afflicted, discouraged ones,
and to visit them; it often proving comparable to iron sharpening iron.
I returned home on Seventh-day considerably indisposed.
Feeling better on First-day, set out again in order to attend Concord Quarterly Meeting.
Here I thought that an evidence was afforded that the Great and Good Master continues
to regard His children who desire to serve Him in nothingness of self.

"`12th month 25th. For some weeks past I have felt much poverty of spirit;
and went to meeting today under the same feeling.
But in the renewal of heavenly mercy,
my mind was clothed with supplication on my own behalf, and on behalf of those assembled,
which seemed as though it ought to be vocally expressed.
But the awfulness of approaching the High and Holy One,
attended with a fear lest I should express words unbidden, so prevailed,
that the meeting closed while I was under the exercise;
which left me in a tried state of mind, and closely proved.
Oh Thou who art touched with a feeling of our infirmities,
be pleased in Thy goodness and mercy to compassionate my weakness,
and for the few remaining days of my life,
give me more faith and strength to obey thy blessed voice,
and help me to be instant in season, that I may not become a castaway.

"`3rd month 2nd, 1843.
In company with my children,
I paid a visit to a family where the female head
and the children are members of our Society;
and feeling drawn in tender solicitude towards the dear youth,
there being a number of them present,
and endeavoring to keep my ear open to the discipline of the cross,
way was made for me to express what was on my mind, much to the relief of it;
and the retrospect affords solid peace.

"`7th. Since the last date I have several times visited
the sick and afflicted in this neighborhood,
to my satisfaction.
On one of these occasions, I met with a young man unexpectedly,
for whose preservation from the lo! heres, and lo! theres,
I had felt for some time solicitous;
and an opportunity offering for me to express my feelings to him,
in embracing it I felt the reward of peace.
Gracious Father, be pleased to keep me humble and watchful,
not seeking great things for myself.

"`At the time of our Quarterly Meeting in last month, I was indisposed,
and did not get there.
But my mind was drawn towards Friends in their collective capacity,
particularly the burden bearers,
in desire that they might carefully look to the great I Am;
and that He would condescend to direct their steps
in the important service for which they had met.

"`Brother S. Rhoads, having been a considerable time in declining health,
was suddenly deprived of the use of his right side and of his speech,
on the night of the 2nd of the present month.
Suffering appeared to be his portion at times, until the 4th,
when between 8 and 9 o`'clock in the morning, he quietly ceased to breathe,
leaving the consoling evidence that he had not followed cunningly devised fables,
but solid and substantial truths;
and giving good ground to believe that through the power of redeeming love,
his soul had been prepared to enter the mansions of eternal blessedness.
On the 6th his remains were interred in the burial ground at Darby,
after a season of solemn retirement at his late dwelling, in which some,
who had been long neglecting the all important work of the soul`'s salvation,
were affectionately and pressingly invited to accept
the offers of redeeming grace while time was afforded;
and the beloved youth were tenderly encouraged to increasing dedication.
Thomas Kite and Elizabeth Evans were in attendance.

"`17th. Under a sense of my own unworthiness this morning,
my mind is drawn in desire to the Father of mercies,
that He would be pleased not to forsake me;
hoping I can in sincerity adopt the language of the Psalmist,
'`As the hart panteth after the water brook, so panteth my soul after thee,
O God!`' Be pleased, holy Father, in thine own time to scatter my soul`'s enemies,
and put the armies of the aliens to flight!
For thou alone art able to do it.

"`4th month.
I attended our Yearly Meeting.
Although there are yet many causes remaining for exercise,
it was a time of renewed favor, wherein ability was given to the rightly exercised,
to labor for the repairing of the waste places.
May the praise all be given to Him to whom it belong, in the abasement of self.

"`Soon after my return from Philadelphia, and after visiting a friend in affliction,
I went to Coatesville, and spent some time with my children;
they having lately gone to housekeeping.
It was pleasant to be with them in their own home; and the craving of my spirit is,
that they may be increasingly concerned to seek first the kingdom of heaven,
and the righteousness thereof.

"`From Coatesville I went to Concord, and attended the Fifth-month Quarterly Meeting.
After which I visited a sorrowful widow, R. T.,
who had recently been bereaved of a precious husband.
It seemed to me, if the present afflictive dispensation was patiently abode under,
it would be sanctified to her and her family:
giving them to see the uncertainty of all mutable enjoyments.

"`6th month.
I paid a visit to my relatives in Philadelphia;
and in the course of it attended Arch Street meeting.
It felt to be a low time: comparable to toiling all night and catching nothing.
Oh that the true burden-bearers may be sustained by the power of His might,
who alone is able to strengthen them to bear the burdens of the present day;
occasioned by a busy, active spirit having found its way into our Society,
which would draw away from the spirituality of our holy profession;
tending to divide in Jacob, and scatter in Israel.

"`4th. I attended our meeting at Darby,
wherein ability was given vocally to supplicate the High and Holy One for strength
to persevere in the way He may be pleased to cast up for me to walk in;
and through the redeeming power of His love, be enabled to say from season to season,
not my will but thine be done.
While I write, my mind is clothed with peaceful quiet;
a favor for which I desire to be grateful.
Thou, O Lord,
only knowest the conflicts and bitterness which I have experienced in days that are past,
and at seasons are yet permitted!
I ask not a release from baptism and exercise;
but that Thou would be pleased to keep me through them to the reduction of my own will,
and to thine honor; being renewedly sensible,
that any efforts of our own to promote Thy righteous cause, will be unavailing.`"

+++[+++The Apostle Paul says, "`I know nothing by myself.`"
We suppose this has been the experience of all the truly
humbled and contrite followers of the Lord Jesus,
from that day to this.
These know that all their well-springs,
all their ability for any good word and work is from Him alone,
without whom we can do nothing.
These have realized that the stripping chamber of deep spiritual exercise,
and the renewed baptism of the Holy Ghost,
is that which only qualifies for the daily work of the Lord; and which,
with fervent wrestling prayer,
opens the door of light and life unto Him who will ever remain the Alpha and Omega,
the wisdom and the anointing of all His self-denying and obedient followers.
Our beloved friend seems to have experienced this;
and hence how frequent and fervent are her appeals to the throne of grace and mercy,
for that help and strength which the Lord of life and glory
delights to grant to His faithful dependent children.]

"`6th month 18th. On our way to meeting this morning,
we were informed of the death of Thomas Rudolph,
a friend who had been at meeting the Fifth-day before, but left it indisposed.
On hearing the affecting intelligence,
my mind was dipped into tender sympathy with the bereaved widow and her fatherless children,
one of whom, a precious young woman, is deprived of the use of her lower limbs.
In being with them in the afternoon, in company with my dear friend Sarah Hilman,
who had acceptably attended our meeting that day, it felt to me a solemn time,
and desires were raised that the afflicted family might be enabled to say,
'`though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.`' The funeral was largely attended.
At the grave my mind was impressively arrested with the language: '`Be ye also ready,
for at such an hour as ye think not,
the Son of man cometh.`' Fearing I should fall into condemnation if I withheld,
I therefore ventured in much self-abasedness, I trust,
to express what arose lively in my mind to that large gathering.
The day had been an exercising one,
and in the evening the language presented impressively, '`Return unto thy rest,
O my soul,
for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.`' '`Who redeemeth thy life from destruction!
Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender
mercies.`' O may I never forget to wait upon Him,
and be increasingly willing to obey Him.`"

+++[+++Hannah Gibbons, from her memoranda,
appears to have been one of those inward and watchful Christians, who, in her measure,
like the Psalmist, guarded against presumptuous sins,
that they should not have dominion over her.
Thus we see in multiplied instances, how careful she was in the exercise of her gift,
not to presume to offer strange fire on the Lord`'s altar:
but was engaged often to wait upon Him,
"`as the eye of the maiden is to the hand of her mistress`" to know His will,
and then in His strength, made perfect in weakness, to do it.
Neither did she deem any precept or injunction of Holy Scripture,
nor any supposed need be seen only with the outward eye,
a sufficient commission to engage in such a responsible calling.
But was concerned to wait often upon the Lord for the renewal of spiritual strength;
to tarry as at the city of Jerusalem--in thorough self-reduction, fear,
and subjection of spirit,
which bends the natural will to the cross of Christ--for
the alone qualifying power from on high:
and to experience the "`woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel,`" before
going forth to speak in the name of Him who is a God of knowledge,
and who looketh on the heart.
Her journal is full of this kind of evidence,
and it is no doubt owing to her faithfulness in the day of small things,
and to letting obedience keep pace with knowledge,
to the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
that she was enabled to grow in spiritual stature through the progressive stages,
unto a pillar in the temple of her God, which should go no more out.]

"`8th month 27th, 1843.
In our meeting (Darby) my mind became exercised in fear
that some were slighting the day of merciful visitation,
and the call seemed renewed to proclaim among us,
that the '`foundation of God standeth sure.`' I had also to supplicate
on behalf of those who were standing at a distance;
that they may through redeeming love and mercy, be brought near,
and finally be prepared to sing the song of praise to Him who is worthy forever.

"`In the latter end of the 8th month or early in the 9th,
I attended the funeral of M. T. After it, had an opportunity with her husband,
which was relieving to my mind.
In the afternoon I went to see Hannah Rudolph and family,
and was comforted in being with them,
and witnessing the resigned humble state of mind dear Mary, the afflicted daughter,
is in.
I said, surely it is the Lord`'s doing, and marvellous in my eyes.
May our Heavenly Father keep them, both mother and children, near unto himself.

"`9th month 12th. I attended the funeral of my dear aged friend, R. L.,
whose pious example speaks to us, her survivors, Follow me,
as I endeavored to follow Christ.
In the afternoon of the same day I attended the funeral of Elizabeth Jones,
a young woman in the prime of life, and only daughter of aged parents.
My mind was dipped into near sympathy with them; but who can say, What doest Thou?
and I trust they do not mourn as those who have no hope.
It was a day of serious thoughtfulness to me,
and desires were raised that I might be increasingly concerned
to know my day`'s work going on with the day.

"`10th month.
After passing through close exercise in the prospect of attending Baltimore Yearly Meeting,
and some others on the way, it seemed best to mention it in our Monthly Meeting.
Having obtained the approbation of it, and my dear friends, Isaac and Jane Garrett,
being willing to accompany me, we accordingly set out on the 23rd,
and attended Little Britain aml Nottingham meetings,
and reached Baltimore Sixth-day evening.
The Select Meeting for Ministers and Elders, held on Seventh-day morning,
was to me a comfortable, confirming season.
I thought afterwards, if, in the meetings for discipline,
a little more deliberation had been attended to in the weighty concerns of the Society,
it would have been more consistent with the dignity of the occasion:
yet through the condescending goodness of Israel`'s Shepherd,
His solemnizing presence was at seasons felt among us;
and O how did my heart crave an increase of it!
On our return we attended Deer Creek Meeting on First-day, and dined at C. Stumps,
an aged widow, to whom I felt my mind drawn in a particular manner.
The language of encouragement flowed towards her, and after expressing what arose,
and a few words to her son,
we came to Samuel Worthington`'s. Here I had an opportunity of writing to my cousin,
I+++.+++ H., for whom I felt an earnest solicitude,
that he might be turned from the broad into the narrow way,
which leads to life and peace: then feeling relieved and peaceful, we, on Second-day,
turned our faces homeward,
and came to my brother Samuel Pusey`'s. He being
in a declining state of health from a paralytic affection,
I concluded to remain with him a few days.
After which I reached home safely 10th of Eleventh month;
with a thankful heart to Him who had enabled me to
perform what I believed He required of me.
I may add, that on my way to Baltimore, when a few miles from my brother`'s,
we heard of his illness;
and on seeing him I was brought under close trial in the prospect of leaving him, when,
in all human probability, I should not see him again.
But the pointing seemed to be to go forward, and I had peace in it.
Oh! it is good to confide in Him who knoweth what is best for us.
I was favored to see my dear brother again,
and feel grateful for the privilege of being with
him a little while in his afflicted situation,
and more especially as it appeared as though it might be the last opportunity
we should have of being together while in this state of mutability.

"`My dear brother Samuel Pusey departed this life Eleventh month 25th, 1843,
in the 71st year of his age.
The solemn tidings were conveyed to me a few days afterwards, and though not unexpected,
it was affecting, feeling renewedly that the ties of natural affection are very strong,
but I was consoled with a little hope, that his soul had found a resting place in Heaven.
I being now the only remaining one of my father`'s first
children--nine in number--I often feel lonely and stripped:
but my desires are frequently raised to the Father of mercies,
that He may be pleased to enable me to walk more acceptably in His sight,
so that my life may be more consistent with the gospel of His dear Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord.

"`12th month 2nd. I left home in order to visit my son`'s family,
where we met with our dear friends Casson and R. Priestman.
They being on a family visit within the compass of London Grove Monthly Meeting,
called a second time at my son`'s, where we again fell into silence,
and they each had a little to communicate.
How do such seasons strengthen the weary traveller!
May I live under an abiding sense that they are not at our command.
From Coatesville we went to see my dear friend Lydia Brinton, who is in declining health.
We both being widows, can feel for each other.
Having long been acquainted, and I trust sweetly united in best things,
I was glad in being permitted once more to be with her.
We also visited some of our relations and friends at Lampeter.
Oh! how is my mind exercised when in that neighborhood, where I resided so long,
on account of very tender feelings for the welfare of its inhabitants being entertained.
I was renewedly impressed with a concern while there, on behalf of two individuals,
who I feared were living careless of their best interests;
and a desire to visit them was felt, which was humiliating.
Oh, it is a great thing to be willing to be a fool for Christ`'s sake.
My brother, A. Gibbons, accompanied me to the house of one of them,
where way soon opened for me to relieve my mind to him, which appeared to be well taken:
all of which was cause of thankfulness.
The other person had no settled home.
This, in connection with our time being limited, discouraged me,
and I did not urge as much inquiry after him,
as I thought afterwards would have been best.
O Father of mercies!
Thou knowest my frailties.
Be pleased to pass by and forgive all my omissions and commissions.
If thou shouldst mark iniquity, who shall stand?`'

"`1st month 11th, 1844.
On our way to meeting, we called to see sister Sarah Rhoads,
who has been a considerable time in declining health.
When sitting in her chamber we were unexpectedly refreshed with a feeling of sweet solemnity;
in which the language of encouragement arose toward the dear afflicted one,
and I ventured to express it.
It felt to me a time of renewed favor, and cause of gratitude to the Father of mercies.
In our meeting, my mind was humbled and clothed with the spirit of supplication,
which it seemed right to utter.
Yielding thereto, it felt a solemn time, and an acceptable sacrifice.
Oh! what a favor to such a poor thing as I am,
who often feel indeed as a '`worm and no man.`' On the evening
of the 23rd sister Rhoads departed this life.
Having been a woman of a meek and quiet spirit, I trust her end was peace.
Her remains were interred in Friends`' burying ground at Darby on the 25th.

"`24th. Today I became seriously indisposed with dizziness in my head,
and numbness and weakness in my right limb from the knee downward,
attended with general debility of body.
This impressed me seriously,
and seemed a renewed call to look over the leaves of my life,
and endeavor to have my accounts in readiness.
Though I have been preserved from gross evils,
yet I find many steps have been taken out of the right way;
and a fear often possesses my mind, lest some of my exercises, professedly religious,
have been too much in the mixture.
Oh!
Thou who knowest the intent of the heart,
be pleased to pass by all that is offensive unto Thee,
and in Thy redeeming love and mercy, blot out all my sins and iniquities,
and remember them no more: and if consistent with Thy holy will,
grant that my name may be written in the Lamb`'s book of life.
O, I have nothing to trust to but Thy mercy.

"`2nd month.
Attended our Quarterly Meeting under considerable bodily infirmity.

"`Our dear friends D. and A. C. from Carolina, were there on their way to Philadelphia,
in order to embark for Ireland, etc., on a religious visit,
hoping to reach there in time to attend the Yearly Meeting in Dublin.
Our dear friend Sarah Emlen opened a prospect which had long impressed her mind,
and at times solemnly, to visit Friends in the love of the gospel in England and Ireland:
which after a time of solid deliberation was feelingly united with,
and she encouraged in the important service,
the unity of her Monthly Meeting having been already obtained.

"`In the Fifth month, I attended the Quarterly Meeting at Caln.
It was comfortable to me to be once more permitted to sit with my dear friends there,
with whom I was so long united in exercise.
I thought it was a time of renewed favor.
Our friend T. Kite was also there.
I went from Caln to Concord,
and attended the Quarterly Meeting to a good degree of satisfaction.

"`5th month. 1844.
Having for some time felt an engagement of mind to go and see some
colored families who live in and about the village of Haddington,
and give them some religious tracts, on First-day afternoon, 12th of 5th month,
S+++.+++ R. accompanying me, we accordingly went to see these poor neglected fellow creatures.
Most of them appeared grateful for the little attention paid them,
and it affords a peaceful retrospect.

"`Some days afterwards, I went, accompanied by my worthy friend E. Garrett,
to see a young man, who it was feared was walking in the way that leadeth to destruction.
He appeared willing to hear what I had to communicate,
and after giving him some religious tracts, we left him:
my mind being relieved and peaceful, for which I was thankful,
having felt something stirring within me towards him for some time.
These comparatively small acts of apprehended duty are humiliating;
and I have earnestly desired to be preserved from kindling a fire in my own wisdom,
and warming myself by the sparks thereof; lest I should have to lie down in sorrow.`"

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++The watchful, christian care exercised by our dear friend,
in respect to all her religious acts and movements, is very observable and instructing.
The natural man can do nothing to the glory of God; that holy, all-wise Being,
who also is sufficient for His own work, and who,
requiring all our sacrifices to be the fruits of the new creation,
will not accept either the lame or the blind, or any other product of the unrenewed mind.
We are poor, weak, and blind creatures;
having nothing but what is in mercy dispensed to us from the Treasury on high.
How wise then is it, like this well instructed scribe, to wait diligently,
though patiently, for the anointing and alone qualifying power of our holy Redeemer,
who in merciful condescension, when He putteth forth His sheep, goeth before them;
prepares the way; accepts the sacrifice; gives them their penny of peace.]

'''

"`In the 6th month, I paid a visit to my children at Coatesville,
and also to my dear sister Edith Edge and family,
which felt to me a time of strengthening in the bonds of near fellowship.

"`7th month 20th. Having felt exercised for some time past in the
prospect of attending the half Yearly meeting in Virginia,
and if way opens to visit the meetings constituting it, the subject feels weighty,
and renewedly so this morning.
The language frequently arises, '`send out thy light and thy truth:
let them lead me.`' And make me willing, by the baptismal influence of Thy Holy Spirit,
to obey all Thy requirings.
Preserve me, I pray Thee,
from every false appearance that would draw away
from Thy pure life into the mixture of fleshly wisdom;
being renewedly made sensible that my standing is as on a sea of glass;
and that our soul`'s enemy would, if possible, deceive the very elect.
Oh, gracious God! preserve me, I pray Thee, on the sure foundation, the Rock of ages,
which Thou alone art;
that so none of the fiery darts of the wicked one may be suffered to prevail against me.

"`9th month 29th. My mind has also been exercised
on account of visiting the prisoners in Chester prison;
a service which appeared too weighty for me, and very humiliating;
but the subject pressing heavily upon me, and remembering we are not our own,
but are bought with a price, I mentioned it to a few friends; who, not discouraging me,
on the 26th, accompanied by my kind friends Isaac and Jane Garrett, I went to Chester.
And after the needful care being taken, and no objection being made by the sheriff,
next morning we visited the prisoners, eight in number,
accompanied by our worthy friend Enos Sharpless.
Oh! how I craved that they might be redeemed from all iniquity,
and brought into a state of acceptance in the Divine sight;
remembering that the mercy-seat of the Most High covers His judgment seat.
The prisoners behaved well; and some of them were solid and attentive.
I felt much relieved after the opportunity, and a sweet reward afforded,
as also for visiting an individual not in prison,
who appears to lie careless of his best interests;
for both which I hope I feel thankful.`"

'''

+++[+++The next religious service which engaged our friend Hannah Gibbons,
was the visit to the half-year`'s meeting of Virginia, and the meetings constituting it.
She had for companions her friends Jane and Edward Garrett,
and left home 10th month 1st. She speaks of kind friends throughout the visit,
and of some favored seasons; but generally the meetings were small,
and for the most part low times.
They were absent nearly three weeks, and reached their homes in health and safety,
which she acknowledged as "`cause for humble thankfulness
to the Author of all our sure mercies,
serious sickness prevailing in places they visited.]

[.small-break]
'''

"`11th month 16th. For the last few weeks a deep concern has been felt
on account of a man in Moyamensing prison under sentence of death;
but from a feeling of my own unfitness, and a fear of being mistaken,
my mind became closely exercised.
After due consideration, and apprehending it was a duty required,
I yielded to the prospect; and felt easy to mention it to my valued friend Thomas Kite,
who had been to see him, and was willing to accompany me.
Thomas and I communicated what arose by way of testimony,
and he was favored in supplication to the Father of mercies for the poor man.
It was a time of much feeling, and there was cause to hope,
that he was in some degree sensible of the sinfulness of sin,
and the necessity of seeking a place of repentance.
I was relieved and thankful in believing the good Hand was with us.
Next day I went towards Concord with Jane and Edward Garrett,
to attend the Quarterly Meeting.
We called at William Smedley`'s,
whose wife appears to be drawing towards the close of life.
She is in a sweet frame of mind.
It was a privilege to sit by her, and be permitted to feel, as I thought we did,
a precious covering.

"`12th month 13th. Since my return from our late visit to Virginia,
I have had seasons of sweet consolation in the retrospect of it;
and cause to bless the Holy Name who enabled me to perform it,
in the seventy-fifth year of my age.
But the dispensation being changed, and this having been a day of conflict,
the language has often arisen, Lord, look down upon me in mercy,
and enable me to see in Thy precious light, what thou art requiring of me.
Suffer me not, I pray Thee to be deceived by the enemy of my soul`'s happiness.

"`1st month 11th, 1845.
The past few weeks has been a time of exercise and proving;
but this morning a little of that bread that nourisheth, hath been mercifully afforded,
for which I desire to be thankful.
May I be kept humble, and may my faith in the all-sufficiency of Divine power fail not.

"`22nd. The 16th of this month was thirteen years since I was left a widow.
Many exercises and trials have been experienced during that time, as well as before;
and the language hath often arisen, if the Lord had not been my support,
where would my dwelling have been at the present day?
My mind is now earnest in desire for safe guidance and protection
through the remaining steps of my life.
Be pleased, O Father of all our sure mercies, to be with me, unworthy as I am,
and uphold me with the right hand of Thy righteousness;
and give me strength to praise Thy ever excellent Name, who hath done much for me.

"`2nd month 13th. The 8th day of this month I was seventy-five years of age;
and looking over my past life,
I feel renewedly that I have been permitted to pass
through many seasons of deep probation and trial,
known only to Him who knoweth the secret baptisms of every soul;
and an evidence seems granted that He hath been with me when I knew it not.
Gracious Father! be pleased, if I am found worthy in Thy sight,
to continue to be with me; be a light to my feet, and a lamp to my path,
the few remaining days of my life, that I err not.

"`4th month 19th. I attended our Select Yearly Meeting;
also the several sittings of the Yearly Meeting the following week.
It was a time of close exercise and proving to many,
owing to a spirit being afloat that is striving to draw the minds
of many away from the simplicity of the Truth as we profess,
and also from the spirituality of our high and holy profession;
into an easier way and superficial religion.
Of these restless people,
I believe it may be said as it was of the Jews and Greeks formerly,
the cross of Christ has become a stumbling block, and foolishness.
But through the condescending goodness of our heavenly Helper,
the solid part of the meeting was enabled to go forward with the business,
in much unison of feeling, and I trust to the praise of Him whose work it is,
and who does not forsake His humble depending children.

"`6th month 3rd, 1845.
Since my last memorandum was penned, I paid a visit to my children at Coatesville,
also to my sister E. Edge and family, and some other relatives in that neighborhood,
and to my dear friends at Lampeter.
In each of these places I felt desirous of being preserved in the fear of the Lord,
and attentive to any little service that might open in a religious way,
as well as to attend to my social duties.
After passing through much exercise while in the neighborhood of Coatesville on account
of an impression of duty to make a visit to a person who kept a public house,
I mentioned it to a Friend in the station of elder, who was willing to accompany me.
An opportunity of seeing him being obtained, I communicated what impressed my mind;
and afterward the reward of sweet peace was afforded.
While at Lampeter I became much drawn to a family who were entire strangers to me;
which also occasioned much exercise.
But as I endeavored to know the mind of Truth and yield to it,
way opened for my calling to see them, and to convey what I felt towards them,
which appeared kindly received,
and afforded the reward of that peace which the world can neither give nor take away.
At London Grove my mind became attracted towards an individual,
some of whose ancestors I had been acquainted with in younger life:
but way not opening for me to get to see him,
perhaps for want of my not being sufficiently resigned, and partly also from a fear,
lest in this day of unsettlement and many voices,
I should be drawn away with a strange voice.
But He who knoweth the integrity of my heart, knoweth I desire to serve Him;
and if way opens in future for the relief of my mind, it will be a mercy.
If on the contrary, an omission of duty has been irretrievably made, be pleased, O Lord,
to let not Thine hand spare, nor Thine eye pity,
till all that is within me is removed that opposes Thy blessed will,
and a willingness experienced to follow Thee in a childlike simplicity,
whithersoever Thou art pleased to lead:
that I may know Thy rod and Thy staff to comfort me.
Afterwards,
when on a family visit to Friends in the neighborhood of the before-mentioned individual,
way opened to have a religious opportunity with him and his family, much to my relief.`"

+++[+++When the eye is kept single to the Great Counsellor in the heart,
as well as the Great Controller of events,
and the government of all placed upon His shoulders, how He prepares the way for,
and opens the door unto His obedient, humble, patient followers.
These have no lack of either wisdom or strength to fulfill His will,
which is their sanctification.
To these, the how, the what, and the when are all opened,
through the power of his Holy Spirit, to their quickened understanding.
So that though weakness and fear may seem at times to bring into bondage,
yet will the Lord of life and of glory, re-anoint for His work;
out of weakness make strong; renew His covenant as in the case of Levi,
because of the filial fear of His obedient children;
and enable again to take fresh courage, and to run the race set before them.
Thus, well has it been said that He will not allow His faithful,
dedicated ones very far to contravene His blessed will and purposes concerning them.

9th month 22nd, 1835.

[.salutation]
My Dear Brother:

My feelings became much interested in thy best welfare the last time I was in thy company;
which interest has often since revived,
attended with earnest desires that thou might come to experience the day`'s
work going on with the day,-- even the very important work of thy soul`'s salvation.
Time is short, and very uncertain; and to improve it, to our everlasting advantage,
ought to be our primary concern.
We may promise ourselves length of days,
and still go on in the gratification of our natural inclinations.
But oh! how presumptuous it is for poor frail man,
who knoweth not that he may be permitted to see the light of another day,
to conclude that at some future period he will become more religious.
Delays are ever dangerous.
We may endeavor to amuse and to satisfy ourselves
with the fascinating things of this life,
and go on neglecting the still small voice, which is heard as in the cool of the day,
saying, This is the way, walk thou in it.
This blessed Monitor though long afforded, may yet be withdrawn.
For it is recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, as the language of the Saviour,
that '`the night cometh:`' and,
'`My spirit shall not always strive with man.`' It is therefore very important
to us that we accept the offers of redeeming love while they are extended,
for most assuredly times and seasons are not at our command.
Moreover we have an unwearied enemy, who will, if possible, frustrate every good desire,
and bring to the experience of that which is written, '`When I would do good,
evil is present with me.`' But how encouraging is the language,
'`Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.`' Therefore I beseech thee,
my dear brother, in the feelings of tender love,
to put not off the work till a more convenient season; but look unto Him,
who is touched with a feeling of our infirmities,
and who knows how to succor those who are tempted, and will, when temptations present,
if sought unto in sincerity and faith, make a way for our escape.

Blessed be His Holy Name, I think I know what I write from a degree of experience;
and therefore feel an earnest solicitude for thy encouragement,
that thou mayst trust in the Lord with all thy heart,
and lean not to thy own understanding.
Thus submitting to the cleansing, purifying operations of Divine love,
even the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire,
which is of Him '`whose fan is in His hand,`' He will, if there is a yielding thereunto,
'`thoroughly purge his floor,
and gather the wheat into the garner;`' and cause
us to experience the floor of our hearts washed,
and a willingness wrought to obey the dictations of the Holy Spirit;
by which we shall know from time to time the armies of the aliens to be put to flight,
even our souls`' enemies, and our faith and hope increased in Him, whose we are,
and in whom we live, move, and have our being;
and who has an undoubted right to the dedication of our whole hearts.
I write not as one that hath attained unto much,
but as one who is desirous of pressing onward in the christian warfare;
whose primary concern I trust it is at seasons to have the day`'s work done in the daytime.
That this may be thine also, my dear brother,
is the present breathing solicitude of my mind.

[.signed-section-closing]
Thy truly affectionate sister,

+++[+++Her memoranda are resumed under date:]

"`7th month 31st, 1845.
I often feel the present,`" she writes, "`to be a day of trial, yea,
of much shaking in our Society.
Be pleased, O Father of mercies, to continue to shake us,
until that which is offensive to thee, may be removed;
that that which cannot be shaken only may remain,
and through the power of Thy love grow brighter and brighter;
that so the ever blessed Truth may shine more conspicuously among us as a people,
even as in ancient purity.
Thou knowest, O Lord, the breathing of my spirit is often unto Thee,
in desire to be preserved from the mixture of self in every performance
professedly for the promotion of Thy righteous cause,
that the enemy of my soul`'s peace may not be suffered,
through any of his wily insinuations, to draw me away from Thy precious light and truth!
Wilt thou be pleased to increase my spiritual vision;
give me to see with an eye of faith, unto holy certainty,
the things that belong to Thy honor and my peace,
vouchsafe to me strength to perform them;
suffer me not to go before the pointings of Thy blessed finger, I pray Thee,
neither to lag behind, that so I may be preserved from becoming a castaway.

"`8th month 17th. I left home to attend our Quarterly Meeting at Concord.
In it my dear friend and relative Sarah Emlen,
gave a satisfactory account of her recent visit to England and Ireland, which,
with her safe return, is cause of gratitude to the Author of all our sure mercies.
She was enabled to perform the service under considerable bodily infirmity,
and now having returned relieved and peaceful,
is cause for other humble travellers to thank God and take courage.

"`My mind was exercised before I left home on account
of a young man in West Chester prison,
under sentence of death for the commission of murder.
The exercise so increased that I was induced to mention it to the elders of our meeting;
who not discouraging me,
and feeling an impression of mind to communicate
it to my friends Nathan Sharpless and Sarah Emlen,
I found the latter was under a similar exercise.
This was very cordial to my poor mind;
and confirming also was the willingness of the former to accompany us.
The necessary arrangements being made, on the 21st of the month,
in company with Abraham Gibbons and Martha Jeffries, we visited the poor convict.
Our feelings were sorrowful;
yet we were a little comforted in seeing him brought somewhat into a state of contrition.
May the Lord Almighty grant him the gift of true repentance.
The foregoing act of dedication hath been crowned with sweet peace.

"`On the evening of the same day,
feeling a lively intimation to step in and see an old man who was in bodily affliction,
having a wife and son living with him, who all appear to be thoughtful people,
I yielded to it.
My feelings were comfortable in sitting with them, and the language arose,
'`As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people,
even henceforth and forever.`' It felt to me that the Good Hand was round about them,
though strangers to me.
They appeared grateful for the visit, and I was thankful in having performed it.
After which I was favored to retire to rest with a sweet reward.

"`9th month 1845.
My mind became exercised in desire for the welfare
of some men who were at work on the highway,
with an intimation to hand them some tracts on religious subjects.
This so increased as they drew near my present dwelling,
that I feared being in neglect of duty if I omitted attending to my feelings.
Accordingly I spoke to the Supervisor in respect to it.
Though a stranger, he encouraged me; and when a suitable opportunity offered,
I handed him the tracts to distribute among the men,
while I communicated to them what arose in my mind.
They all behaved civilly, and some were attentive.
This took place in the evening: but not feeling quite relieved,
when they collected next morning, I stepped near to most of them,
and inquired if they were all well;
expressing my desire that the Almighty might be with them and bless them;
and then bid them farewell.
After which I felt relieved; and a portion of that joy was experienced,
with which the stranger cannot intermeddle;
and which is at times given to those who are made willing
to follow the blessed Master in the way of the cross.

"`In the 10th and 11th months, feeling a renewal of exercise on account of Jabez Boyd,
the before-mentioned young man in prison at West Chester,
attended with an apprehension of duty again to visit him,
it was very humiliating and yielded to much in the cross.
But finding my dear friend S. Emlen was also exercised on his account,
and willing to accompany me, it somewhat lighted the burden.
We accordingly visited him several times; and were a little comforted in the hope,
that through the condescending goodness and mercy of our merciful Creator, his sins,
though of a deep dye, would be permitted to go beforehand to judgment.

"`This youth was executed the 21st of Eleventh month.
We also visited his parents, and the parents of the innocent youth who was murdered;
they all living in the neighborhood of West Chester.
The latter family, appeared to be an orderly, pious one,
who knew where to look for support in times of deep affliction.
It was a satisfactory visit;
and they expressed much gratitude for being remembered in that time of close trial.

"`In the course of our being in and about West Chester,
I was brought into close exercise in the prospect of having a religious
opportunity with all the prisoners in the prison where Boyd had been confined;
and also to have a meeting,
more especially for the laboring class of people in and about West Chester.
Finding that dear S. Emlen was similarly bound, and not only so,
but prepared for an early procedure, it felt very weighty to me indeed,
attended with much fear, lest I should be meddling in things too mighty for me.
But as a little light seemed to shine upon it,
I ventured to mention the subject to the elders of my own meeting;
who not discouraging me, and an opportunity likewise offering of expressing my prospect,
in company with S. Emlen, to the elders and ministers of Chester Monthly Meeting, they,
after solid consideration, encouraging us to pursue the prospect,
arrangements were made therefor.
The service as respects both, was attended to on First-day, the 10th of Eleventh month.
The meeting with the prisoners was held in the forepart of the day;
wherein we thought it right to step into each of the cells,
and speak to them separately before meeting.
They were not allowed to come out, but the cell doors being left open during the meeting,
it was believed they could hear what was communicated.
It was a solemn, favored time; and I hope will not soon be forgotten by some of them,
there being more than thirty in number.
The meeting in the afternoon, held in Friend`'s Meetinghouse,
was larger than was expected; and I think was a favored one.
May all the praise be given to Him to whom alone it belongs.

"`Next morning I felt as if I should not come home easy
without attempting to see the parents of J. B. again.
We accordingly went, and found the mother and one son at home;
to whom I communicated what arose.
They appeared much more thoughtful and brought down
in their minds than when we visited them before,
particularly the mother.
It seemed to me, she had seen better days,
and that a renewed visitation in mercy was extended to her, even at the eleventh hour.
All that was capable of feeling within me,
craved that she might be made willing to accept it.
Her son also now appeared to be thoughtful.
It was altogether a time of much feeling;
they having recently had the corpse of the executed son buried from their home.

"`12th month 1st. We reached home,
feeling relieved and comforted in the belief of having been engaged,
according to the ability received, in my good Master`'s service, if I may so speak.
Soon after my return, I visited my children at Coatesville.

"`1st month 4th, 1846.
Having often observed that the close of one year, with the beginning of another,
is a time spent by some in feasting,
and in forgetfulness of the gracious Giver of all our blessings,
the language of my heart hath been for them, Lord forget them not,
nor cast them away from Thee,
but be pleased to follow them with the convictions of Thy grace,
until they are made sensible that Thou art God, and changeth not,--the same yesterday,
today, and forever.

"`I went to meeting today under considerable exercise of mind.
After sitting some time, there seemed, I thought, a little handed to communicate,
which in fear was yielded to: after which the spirit of supplication was felt,
and I believe vocal expression of it required.
But the fear and care of being too hasty so impressed my mind,
as to prevent a yielding to it till the meeting closed; when I was closely tried.
Not withstanding this I could appeal to the Searcher of hearts,
that it was not through wilful disobedience;
and desires were renewedly raised to be helped to be faithful in future,
and more instant in season.
Oh! may all my shortcomings tend to increased watchfulness
to keep near to the pointings of the Spirit of Truth.

"`3rd month 8th. I did not go to the Quarterly Meeting at Concord last month, feeling,
as I thought, excused, from the infirmities of increasing age pressing upon me.
But have often through the winter which has just closed,
felt exercised for those around about us,
who appear to be living without God in the world, or too much in forgetfulness of Him.
From the pressure of apprehended duty, I have stepped in to see some of this class,
have given them some religious tracts, and, as way opened,
expressed my earnest desire for their increase in that knowledge,
while time and opportunity are afforded, which appertains to the salvation of the poor,
never-dying soul.
They all behaved with civility,
and some of them received the visit and tracts with expressions of gratitude.
Oh! it is a great thing, I often think,
to be willing to become a fool for Christ`'s sake, and to acknowledge Him before men,
as well as to be preserved from casting a stumbling block in the way of any;
which was my great desire in the foregoing opportunities.
Gracious Father, be pleased to keep me near unto Thyself in all my future steppings,
and in the remembrance that we are not our own, but are bought with a price;
my desire also is to be preserved from indulging too much in ease to the flesh,
which I often feel inclined to; but rather to be diligent in business, serving the Lord,
that while He is pleased to favor me with health and strength,
I may more willingly yield to the manifestations of His blessed will,
which only affords solid comfort.
And Oh! that I may be preserved from every false appearance,
though it may be as in the guise of an angel of light.

"`4th month, 1846.`"
Under this date Hannah Gibbons`' diary states that
she attended our Yearly Meeting of this year;
and after some allusion to its business,
which she records as "`painful,`" thus concludes the memorandum: "`Oh! it was, I believe,
a time of deep searching of heart to very many among us.
Yet blessed be the name of Israel`'s Shepherd,
He manifested himself to be a spirit of judgment to those who sit in judgment;
enabling them to set up a banner in His name,
and to transact the important business of the meeting in
a good degree of that dignity which the blessed Truth gives.
The praise belongs to the Lord alone.

"`5th month 3rd. For a considerable time past,
my mind has been exercised in the prospect of visiting, I trust in gospel love,
the families of London Grove Monthly Meeting, and a part,
or all of those composing New Garden Monthly Meeting.
Believing the time had come,
I mentioned the concern to Friends at our last Monthly Meeting, which was united with.
Jane and Edward Garrett, having the sanction of the meeting,
we were set at liberty to proceed as Truth might open the way.
The feeble aspiration of my heart hath often been,
and so continues to the Father of mercies, that He would be pleased to be with me,
and strengthen me, a poor worm of the dust, for His work and service,
enabling me to do His blessed will and nothing more.

"`5th. I left home, accompanied by my beloved friends, Jane and Isaac Garrett,
(Edward being too much indisposed to go),
and after attending the Monthly Meetings of New Garden and London Grove,
where the concern was united with in each meeting, we entered on the arduous service.
As the visit progressed,
I felt that I should not be excused without our going
through the families of both the meetings;
and was favored to do so; a little of best help being mercifully afforded,
which I thought I was never more sensible of than on the present occasion.
The service was indeed weighty in prospect,
and performed under considerable bodily infirmity:
yet blessed be the name of Him whom I desire to serve, He hath permitted me to return,
unworthy as I am,
(being sensible I am but an unprofitable servant,) with a relieved and peaceful mind.
'`Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Zion.`'

"`Jane Garrett and myself were absent nearly five weeks;
attended the Quarterly Meetings of Concord and Western as they came in course,
and visited about 108 families within the compass of the two Monthly Meetings.

"`9th month 23rd, 1846.
My mind is often in suffering and fear,
lest I am not sufficiently attentive to the requisitions of the dear Master.
Holy Father! be pleased to enable me to keep my eye single unto Thee,
and more and more willing to fulfill all thy requirings;
that so I may know the day`'s work going on with the day.
And if I am worthy,
be pleased to enable me to endure the portion of
suffering allotted me for the body`'s sake,
which is the church, now in this day of close proving and trial.
And oh! '`cast me not off in the time of old age:
forsake me not when my strength faileth.`'

"`11th month.
Having for some time felt my mind a little drawn towards Bucks Quarterly Meeting,
and of late more pressingly,
and finding my beloved friends Jane and Edward Garrett were willing to accompany me,
we accordingly attended it on the 25th and 26th. It is a small Quarterly Meeting,
but more comfortable to me than any I have attended lately; and a hope was revived,
that our poor troubled Society will not be altogether laid waste.
It is a day of close searching of heart to many,
wherein I believe the language formerly uttered is often poured forth:
'`spare thy people O Lord, and give not thine heritage to reproach.`'

"`3rd month 7th, 1847.
Oh! may I be kept more and more in a state of watchfulness and prayer,
that so I may be favored to know more clearly the mind and will of Him,
whom alone in all things, I desire to serve.
This morning I went to meeting under much exercise.
I had not sat long before my mind became earnestly impressed
with desires for some who had seen many days,
and who, I feared, had not been sufficiently concerned about the one thing needful.
And being desirous to be more instant in season than at some other times,
I was helped to express my exercise, much to the relief of my burdened mind.
May all the praise be given to Him to whom it alone belongs, as with my mouth in the dust.

"`30th. Was at our Monthly Meeting,
where a part of the committee appointed by our Quarterly
Meeting in the Eleventh month last,
on account of the reduced and weak state of the Monthly Meeting, was present:
and I thought the help of their spiritual exercise was felt early amongst us.
One of them E. S., conveyed an encouraging testimony to the humble-minded;
at the close of which, I thought the spirit of supplication was poured forth,
and vocal utterance was required through me,
when near access to the footstool of the blessed Author of it,
was mercifully experienced.
It seemed to me, unworthy as we are, a time of renewed favor,
and cause of humble gratitude.
Oh merciful Father! be pleased to '`hold Thou me up,
and I shall be safe,`' arises from a feeling of the need I have of daily help;
being often poor, and stripped, and exercised,
no doubt designed for my furtherance on the spiritual journey.

"`5th month 3rd. Often feeling drawn into sympathy with the afflicted,
I have lately visited several, in their retired dwellings, much to my own satisfaction;
and feel renewedly convinced,
that it is well for those who are favored with health and strength sufficient,
to visit those who are confined at home under affliction.
'`Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.`'

"`7th month.
A few weeks since, I felt my mind drawn towards a young man,
though a stranger as to personal acquaintance, who I feared was walking in the broad way.
My exercise so increased as to induce me to be willing
to send a request for him to call and see me,
not knowing when I should find him at home.
He came and gave me an opportunity of expressing my concern for him;
and also to give him a few tracts.
Gracious Father! be pleased to direct me,
and keep me in the way that is well pleasing unto Thee.
Let me not lean to my own understanding, which Thou knowest I am prone to do.

"`8th month.
Feeling my mind drawn towards two carpenters, though entire strangers to me,
who were at work near Darby meetinghouse, I thought best to mention it to the elders,
who approved of my endeavoring to have an opportunity with them.
On their being spoken to on the occasion, one of them declined sitting with us,
seeming to make light of religious matters; the other sat with us in the meetinghouse,
and behaved in a becoming manner.
After expressing what arose, as well as yielding to vocal supplication, we parted,
under a comfortable hope,
that some serious impressions had been made on the mind of the visited;
and I was relieved and comforted.
May all the praise be given to Him to whom it alone belongs.

"`8th month.
Attended our Quarterly Meeting at Concord under physical infirmity;
the weather being also very warm.
I believe it was a time of favor to some,
but my lot seemed to be strippedness and poverty;
perhaps for want of more entire dedication.
Our valued friend, Christopher Healy, was in attendance,
in the course of his religious visit in those parts.

"`10th month 29th. I recently, by a friend,
sent some tracts on religious subjects to the two carpenters before mentioned.
He saw the one who gave us the opportunity of sitting with him.
There appeared quite an openness to accept the tracts;
and he said he would be willing to receive any thing from me at any time.
I also gave tracts to some laborers on the highway near us, which afforded peace,
and the following language arose,
'`It is better to be a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord
than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.`'

Same date.
"`I think I may say, that I have never felt my present place of abode a settled home;
and have often desired,
if it was not among right things for myself and daughter J. to remain here,
that way might open for us to remove elsewhere.
Of latter time,
the prospect of having a home in West Chester has appeared with some clearness,
yet considering my advanced age,
and the trial of settling in a neighborhood where we are not much acquainted,
is cause for much serious reflection;
under the feeling of which the language of my heart has been, and now arises,
Send down thy light and thy truth, O Lord,
and let them lead us and guide us according to thy blessed will,
in this weighty prospect; not leaning to our own understanding.

"`11th month 8th. I am still desirous of right direction
in relation to our proposed change of residence.
In the feeling of which the language arises,
Oh Lord! thou giver of every good and perfect gift,
be pleased to be with us and help us to stay our minds upon Thee.

"`Our dear friend Elizabeth Evans attended our meeting yesterday,
and I thought was favored to minister suitably to us, and to supplicate for us;
whereby faith and hope were a little renewed in the all-sufficiency of Divine support.

"`12th month 19th. On the 13th of this month I returned
from a visit to my children at Coatesville.
In the course of my being from home, I went to my brother Abraham Gibbons`'s,
and attended West Chester Meeting.
Also the Monthly Meeting at Sadsbury,
and visited a few of our friends in that neighborhood.
While there,
hearing of a person who was exceedingly afflicted with a cancer in his mouth,
I felt most easy in the prospect of calling to see him.
It was affecting to behold the poor sufferer;
and it arose in my mind to recommend him to seek more and
more for resignation to the dispensations of him,
who afflicteth not willingly, nor grieves the children of men: but chastens in mercy,
in order to draw them nearer to Himself,
condescending at seasons to make the bed of affliction, to the humbled mind,
even a bed of comfort.
I was well satisfied in having called to see him.

"`While we were at West Chester, the subject of our moving there was revived;
and a dwelling near the meetinghouse being offered to us unexpectedly,
the prospect has appeared increasingly clear,
so as to induce a belief it may be realized, if consistent with the Divine will.
Oh Thou, who art a Father to the fatherless, and a Judge of the widow,
be pleased not to suffer us to go unless Thy sustaining Arm go with us.

"`12th month.
A man in this neighborhood being suddenly taken from time to eternity,
the solemn and affecting circumstance made deep impression on my mind;
attended with a desire to visit the bereaved family,
though not personally acquainted with them.
I had many reasonings on the occasion, and fears also,
lest it might arise from sympathy and the cogitations of my own mind,
and not from a Divine requiring; but, as I endeavored to weigh the matter carefully,
it seemed best to mention it to a few friends, who left me at liberty; and the widow,
who was not a member of our Society, appeared quite free to receive a visit.
I therefore went under much exercise.
The family soon drew together,
and I thought there was a feeling of solemnity spread over us.
I endeavored to express what arose, which was principally in the way of sympathy,
and an earnest desire that the awful circumstance which had recently taken place,
might be a means of stirring us up to more diligence in the christian warfare;
and that the bereaved family especially might lay these things to heart,
seeing time is short and very uncertain.
The visit appeared to be acceptable;
and my mind was in a good measure relieved and thankful,
in believing that it was in the putting forth of the good Shepherd of the sheep.

"`1st month 14th, 1848.
Desires having continued to know the Divine will respecting
myself and daughter J. removing to West Chester,
we thought it appeared most in the clearness to do so;
and have accordingly engaged the house before mentioned.
Since which I have been favored with a comfortable degree of quiet;
for which I feel thankful.

"`2nd month 3rd, 1848.
I went to Philadelphia with a view of visiting a friend under affliction,
and also attending the Select Quarterly Meeting on Seventh-day.
But I was taken so poorly that I did not get to meeting.
This occasioned some serious thoughtfulness.
While thus engaged, I remembered the language that was spoken to David,
'`thou did well that it was in thine heart,`' etc.:
after which my mind was settled in quietness,
and I was favored with health to enable me to get home that evening.

"`7th. This day closes my seventy-seventh year!
Many and various have been the deep exercises through
which I have passed in the course of my long life,
which are known only to Him who knoweth all things; yea,
who knoweth the bitterness of every heart, and woundeth in order to heal.
If more days are allotted me,
may they be increasingly dedicated to the service of my Heavenly Father,
the best of masters; who, I trust I may thankfully say,
has followed me with His goodness and mercy all the days of my life.

"`3rd month.
I went to Haddington, accompanied by my daughter J.;
having felt much exercise on account of two individuals,
who I understood were likely to remove,
and who I feared were neglecting their best interests.
I met with one of them, who patiently heard what was delivered;
and I thought seemed to be somewhat impressed with seriousness.
But alas!
I fear for want of applying in good earnest to the Fountain of help and strength,
it will prove as the morning dew that soon passeth away.
The other man I met with at another time not long after, in the road near his dwelling,
being on my way to see him.
We made a little stop,
and I thought it seemed as though the present time had better be made use of,
he being willing to hear me.
I expressed what arose, and I thought some seriousness attended.
Oh! how often is my heart drawn out in desire for those my poor fellow creatures,
who seem to be, as it were, living without God in the world;
that they may yield to the convictions of Divine Grace;
that they may have their hearts turned unto the Lord
while time and opportunity are afforded;
remembering that He hath declared, His spirit shall not always strive with man.
Both the above opportunities were relieving to my mind, and appeared to be well received.
After the last one we went to see several colored families,
and read tracts on religious subjects to them; expressing as way opened,
my desire that they might be increasingly concerned
to seek the Lord while He maybe found.
Oh!
I often feel it is very little we can do one for another,
and yet how desirable it is to be so clear of the blood of all men,
as to be fit to receive the welcome language addressed by our blessed Saviour,
'`Let her alone: she hath done what she could.`'

"`3rd month I went with my daughter J. to Philadelphia to
attend to some business preparatory to going to house-keeping,
and to visit some of our friends.
In the course of our being there I attended three meetings, viz: Arch street,
Sixth street, and Orange street.
In all of them it seemed my place, according to my little ability,
to suffer with the suffering seed in silence.
I believe there is an itching ear in many to hear words; and I fear a desire in some,
through an unsanctified zeal, to express them.
Oh! what darkness does a lifeless ministry bring over a meeting,
and heavy burdens to the living members.
Gracious Father! be pleased to watch over thy church and family;
and strengthen thy little ones to come forward in humility and faith,
in these days of close proving and searching of heart.`"

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++The concluding sentence of the above memorandum of our dear friend,
has reminded of a record of that father in the church, John Churchman,
when near the close of his dedicated life: "`I feel earnest breathings to the Lord,
that there may be those raised up in the church, who may go forth in humility, sweetness,
and life, clear of all superfluity in expressions and otherwise,
standing for the testimony,
that they may be useful to the church in these difficult times.`"

These difficult times have not ceased;
neither truly are we any whit less in need of those, who,
standing for the testimony "`shall go forth,`" as saith H. Gibbons,
"`in humility and faith in these days of close proving and searching of heart.`"
But Oh! how the natural, wise part in man, resisteth this crowning gem,
humility--this self-nothingness and deep abasement of soul at the feet
of the meek and lowly Jesus --how hard to lay the choice treasures,
the fondly gathered stores of the head and heart, at the footstool of the Crucified!
But there is no other way to the crown immortal;
neither any other true way to usefulness in the Church of Christ.
"`To reign it is necessary first to suffer.`"]

'''

"`4th month 30th. The subject of removing to West Chester, is much before me;
and the craving of my mind often is, that Divine Goodness may be so sought after,
and kept near to,
that we may in all our steppings be preserved from
bringing dishonor on the blessed Truth.

"`7th month.
Early in this month we came to our new home in West Chester;
and I can say with a degree of thankfulness, that it feels like home;
and as though it might have been a right move.
Dearest Father! be pleased to keep us near unto Thyself.`"

No date.
"`For some time previous to our changing our place of abode,
my mind became exercised in the prospect of attending Ohio Yearly Meeting:
though from my age, and unfitness every way so pressing upon me,
it seemed for a season as though I could scarcely look to it,
but with feelings of great discouragement.
As the time drew near,
I remembered that all things were possible with Him whom I desired to serve;
and I was enabled, I trust I may say in fear and childlike simplicity,
to open my prospect in the Monthly Meeting at Darby, the beginning of the Eighth month.
Friends uniting therewith, they furnished me with a minute,
setting me at liberty to attend the meeting aforesaid, and also, if way opened,
to visit a few meetings on my way, going and returning.
My dear friend Jane Garrett, being willing to accompany me,
was also furnished with a minute; and next day, my brother Abraham Gibbons,
obtained one from Birmingham Monthly Meeting, in order to join us in our prospect.
We accordingly left home the 26th of the month,
and reached Mount Pleasant safely in five and a half days.

"`The Select Meeting was held on Seventh-day.
Several Friends from other Yearly Meetings,
together with Benjamin Seebohm and Robert Lindsay, from England, were in attendance.
It was a time of suffering and trial to many,
caused by having views on doctrinal points spread among us,
differing from those of our worthy predecessors,
and for which they suffered so much in order to spread and maintain.
The Yearly Meeting commenced on Second-day,
and was throughout a time of close proving to many who
were endeavoring to keep their allotments in the Truth.
My spirit was often in mourning;
and desires were raised that the stumbling blocks cast before the dear youth,
might not turn them out of the right path.
May the Lord be pleased to turn the captivity of Zion, and build all her waste places.
At the close of the Yearly Meeting,
and after attending one appointed meeting at Short Creek, we proceeded homeward;
the prospect of taking a few more meetings on the way still continuing.
But when we got into the neighborhood of Westland Meeting,
and at the house of my kind friends George and Ruth Smith,
I was taken ill and remained nearly three weeks.
Not long after I was thus laid low with sickness,
the language addressed to the disciples formerly by our Divine Master, feelingly revived:
'`When I sent you without purse or scrip, lacked ye anything?
and they said, nothing.`' My feelings were so comfortable for a time,
I thought I could adopt the same reply with thankfulness.
After my health was so restored as to be able,
we sat with Friends in their meetings at Westland, Redstone, and Pike run.
These being relieving to my mind, we set our faces homeward,
where we arrived safely the 18th of Tenth month;
and I trust with minds clothed with gratitude to the Author of all our blessings,
in being thus permitted to return to our comfortable home in safety,
the journey having been performed under much bodily infirmity.

"`Soon after our return home, I attended the Monthly Meeting at Darby,
and returned the minute granted me in the Eighth month last,
with information of the performance of the service
which I believed had been required of me.
I afterwards requested a certificate for myself and daughter to Birmingham Monthly Meeting.
Upon receiving them from the former, and presenting them to the latter Monthly Meeting,
it felt to me a solemn thing to be transplanted again as it were into another soil;
and the breathing of my spirit was and is,
that myself and dear child may be preserved from
bringing dishonor upon the ever blessed Truth,
as it is in Jesus Christ, our Holy Redeemer and Saviour.

"`12th month 31st, 1848.
Our meeting at West Chester today seemed to be favored with a solemn covering;
wherein I felt that a renewed visitation was extended to some present.
May they not only hear the call, but be willing to obey it;
lest the things which belong to their peace be hid from their eyes.

"`The present has been an eventful year to us!
What the coming one may bring forth, is hid from us.
Mayst thou be pleased, O righteous Father, to be with the widow and fatherless,
supporting us through every trial,
and enabling us to dedicate the few remaining days of our lives unto Thee and Thy service!
That so, through Thy adorable goodness and mercy, we may at the last,
be prepared to lay down our heads in peace.

"`3rd month 3rd, 1849.
I have long believed that it was not best for us, poor frail mortals,
to look for much gratification of self; but be willing steadily,
through this probationary state,
to eye our Divine Master; remembering we are not our own, but are bought with a price.
This morning I feel my mind renewedly exercised in
desire to be what the Lord would have me to be,
and to be more and more willing to endure baptism and suffering,
that so all which remains in me that opposes His blessed will may be removed,
and I be enabled to say, with holy magnanimity of soul, not my will,
O righteous Father! but thine be done.

"`5th month 20th. Having been prevented from entering
any account of our late Yearly Meeting until now,
I may say I attended all the sittings of it.
Many minds went up thereto, I believe,
clothed with fervent desires that the Great Head of the
church would condescend to be with the gathered assembly;
which, according to my feeble sense, was mercifully granted;
several sittings of the meeting being favored with His solemnizing presence.

"`After the Yearly Meeting closed, I went to my son-in-law Samuel Rhoads,
and spent a few days,
visiting some whom I had not been to see before I left the neighborhood.
At one place, J. P.`'s,
my mind was impressed with desires for the preservation of him and his wife,
which I ventured to express at the table.
It appeared to be well taken,
and I left them in the feeling of tenderness and quietness of mind.
Upon returning home found my family in usual health, which is cause for thankfulness.

"`5th month.
I attended Caln Quarterly Meeting on the 17th and 18th, wherein I had much to feel,
having been a member of it nearly forty years.
I think it is in a weak state.
Many of the elder class have been removed by death and in other ways,
and too many of the middle aged and younger ones, are I believe making excuses,
and not coming up in that faithfulness which Truth requires.
The following Second-day I attended the Select Quarterly Meeting at Concord;
but being taken with a chill the next morning, followed by fever,
I was not able to attend the meeting that day,
but was favored to get home near evening in quietude of mind.

"`6th month 24th. I ventured again to meeting,
and upon first sitting down felt my mind clothed with solemnity.
After my beloved friend and relative,
S+++.+++ Emlen (she and her family having recently come to West Chester
to reside) expressed by way of testimony what was on her mind,
I thought the spirit of supplication was poured forth;
and after a time being made willing to express vocally what arose,
though in a broken manner, I was favored with a degree of holy quiet,
wherein the language hath been brought to my remembrance,
'`In thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures forevermore.`'

"`9th month 2nd. Having been prevented from time to time, by various circumstances,
from making any entry in this way since the last date,
I may say it has been a time of exercise, and often of much poverty of spirit,
with close proving of heart.
A further trial, of no ordinary nature,
has been permitted in the removal by death of my dear and well-beloved friend and relative,
Sarah Emlen; which took place on Sixth-day night, the 27th of Seventh month last,
in the sixty-third year of her age, of paralysis; by which she was deprived,
a few days before her death, of the use of her right side, and her speech.
She was a bright example of dedication and love to her Divine Master;
and was frequently engaged in promoting his blessed cause of Truth and righteousness.
We labored together in the hope of the Gospel, I trust, according to my ability for it,
in sweet unity.
Although it is a close trial to be deprived of such a fellow-laborer, yet who can say,
'`what doest thou?`' A solemn meeting was held after her interment.

"`Yesterday the remains of our aged friend, Abraham Sharpless, were interred.
Though over ninety years of age he was remarkable for his activity,
and I trust holy zeal in getting to meetings, until within a few weeks of his death.
He appeared much concerned for his own spiritual welfare, and that of others.
In sitting by him in his last illness, and while appearing weighty and tender in spirit,
he with an audible voice expressed as follows: '`Peace be to them that are afar off,
and peace be to them that are near,
and peace be to the Israel of God.`' It was precious to
sit by him and witness the sweet solemnity which prevailed!
I trust he is gathered as a shock of corn, fully ripe, into the heavenly garner.

"`Having endeavored to be faithful at the time of the funeral to that which seemed required,
both at the house and at the grave, I was favored to return with sweet peace.
May the praise be given to Him to whom it alone belongs;
being often sensible that of myself without Divine aid, I can do nothing.
That I may be kept in a humble, childlike state, is the present breathing of my spirit.

"`9th month.
Towards the latter part of this month, I paid a visit to my children at Coatesville,
and to my relatives at London Grove.
While at the latter place, I attended two meetings appointed by our aged friend,
Christopher Healy; one at New Garden, and the other at London Grove.
The latter, the place of my nativity, was an exercising one to me:
but endeavoring to be faithful, I was favored to return home, which I did that afternoon,
without feeling condemnation.

"`10th month 15th. I visited two friends who were under affliction, P. W.,
and A. B. The latter, an aged Friend,
seemed almost overwhelmed with suffering of body and mind:
her only remaining child then lying a corpse; and she having had a fall the day before,
by which she was inwardly hurt.
My mind was dipped into near sympathy with her,
and the passage respecting the disciples formerly,
when they were tossed on the sea and were afraid, presented to me,
which it seemed right to mention; and when they called on their Divine Master in faith,
He arose and rebuked the winds, and the sea, so that there was a great calm:
and that He was still able to calm the troubled mind of His humble, depending children.
It seemed to me a time of renewed favor, and dear A. said it felt like a brook by the way.
The next day I attended the funeral of her son G. B., where a large company collected.
My mind being closely exercised,
I felt constrained at the grave to remind them of the uncertainty of this life,
and the necessity of being diligent in preparing for that which is to come,
while time was in mercy given.
On our way home, W. P. T., being with me,
I felt inclined to stop at a house to which my mind had often been drawn,
though the inmates were strangers to me.
After sitting a little while with them, and expressing what arose,
the language presented, '`surely the Lord is in this place,
and I knew it not.`' The visit appeared acceptable; I was relieved;
and I trust no harm was done; which I esteem a favor,
after having passed through considerable exercise on the occasion.

"`10th and 11th months.
In the course of these months, our friends Christopher Healy, Samuel Bettle,
and Samuel Leeds, attended our meeting.
In each of the meetings attended by them, much labor was bestowed,
and an evidence mercifully granted that the Shepherd of
Israel is still calling unto us through His devoted servants,
for increasing faithfulness to His blessed will.
May fruits appear equal to the favors received,
that so none of us may be as the fruitless fig tree, of which it was said, '`Cut it down,
why cumbereth it the ground.`'

"`15th month 12th, 1850.
Having been exercised for more than a year past in the prospect
of visiting the meetings of Redstone Quarterly Meeting;
and, if way opens for it,
some or all the meetings of Short Creek and Salem Quarterly Meetings in Ohio,
the subject altogether felt weighty.
My own unfitness in a religious sense, with bodily infirmities pressing heavily upon me,
seemed almost appalling;
yet apprehending the time had fully come to open it to my friends,
I did so in our Monthly Meeting the first of the present month.
Having obtained its concurrence,
my daughter J. and cousin James Emlen gave up to accompany me,
which was also approved by the meeting:
since which my mind has been preserved for the most part in quiet trust.
And now the language often arises, '`send down thy light and thy truth,
and let them lead me to thy holy hill and to thy tabernacle.`' And be thou pleased,
O Lord! to preserve me in patience,
and also from bringing dishonor on Thy spotless Truth.
After obtaining liberty of the Quarterly Meeting of Concord,
many Friends expressing tender sympathy,
we set out on our journey the 25th. Next day were at Lampeter Meeting,
to my satisfaction.
Thence, after travelling about a week,
we reached the house of our kind friend S. McG+++.+++,
in the neighborhood of Sewickly Meeting, which we attended.
It is a branch of Redstone Quarterly Meeting.
We next proceeded to the meetings of Salem Quarter, five in number.
From thence, accompanied by our friend J. F., from Salem, we came to,
and were kindly entertained at J. H.`'s; a comfortable resting place.
We attended Cross Creek Meeting on First-day,
Smithfield Monthly Meeting at the same place on Second-day,
and Short Creek Monthly Meeting on Third-day.
These meetings were exercising, but I was enabled to deliver what impressed my mind.

"`We then proceeded to the remaining meetings of Short Creek Quarter,
I think eleven in number, and were at several of them a second time,
feeling an engagement of mind to do so, and which proved relieving.
We then crossed the Ohio river,
and came on to the remaining meetings of Redstone Quarterly Meeting, five in number.
Many deep exercises were my portion in the course of this journey,
under a painful apprehension that the minds of the
people too generally were looking outward,
for that which can alone be found within.
And yet I trust there is a remnant in the different places,
who are desirous of maintaining their fidelity to the King of kings,
and our religious Society on its original foundation.
My mind was often secretly drawn forth on tender solicitude on behalf
of our dear young Friends in this day of trial and unsettlement;
and frequent opportunities occurred, wherein I was engaged,
according to my little ability, to encourage them not to look without,
but to have their minds turned inward to the alone Source of help and strength,
where by they might come to experience an establishment upon that Rock which never faileth.
Having endeavored to do according to that which seemed required,
we were favored to reach home the 17th of Seventh month in safety;
under a thankful sense that a little help had been
afforded from the Holy Sanctuary from time to time,
strengthening me, poor and unworthy as I am,
to cast off the weight of exercise which rested upon me;
nevertheless not being entirely relieved respecting,
and feeling tenderly drawn towards the Monthly Meeting of Middleton, (Ohio),
I addressed a few lines thereto by way of epistle,
which tended wholly to remove the burden,
and enabled me to experience a relieved and peaceful feeling.
May I be sufficiently thankful for such unmerited mercy.

"`Not long after our return from the visit to Ohio,
my mind became religiously concerned on account of a poor unhappy man in prison at Boston,
Massachusetts, under sentence of death for the dreadful crime of murder.
Notwithstanding my desire if consistent with the Divine Will,
to be excused from this heavy exercise of making an attempt to see the criminal,
yet it so increased upon me, as to induce me to consult a few friends there upon.
They felt the subject weighty, but did not altogether discourage me.
After again endeavoring secretly to know the mind and will of my Divine Master,
and not feeling myself excused without making the effort,
my brother-in-law Abraham Gibbons, and Martha Jefferis accompanying me,
we set out on the 23rd of Eighth month, and reached Boston next evening,
the seventh of the week, under as much exercise as my poor mind was well able to support.
The sheriff being inquired for, and not found at home,
we had to await his return in patience, which was not until Second-day morning:
when upon being informed of our desire to see the prisoner,
he said had early chosen his spiritual adviser (so called),
and did not wish to see ministers of other societies;
but our request should be made known to him, and we informed of the result.
Accordingly in a few hours we were told that the prisoner declined seeing us,
but would be willing to receive any written communication from us,
which should be subject to the inspection of the sheriff.

"`Feeling afresh impressed with desires that the mind of the poor,
erring man might be turned inward to the alone Source of help and strength,
and he made sensible of the necessity of a new heart through being born again,
I ventured to address a few lines to him expressive of my exercise,
which were left with the sheriff: after which the language consolingly arose,
'`Let her alone, she hath done what she could.`' And feeling at liberty to return home,
we did so, and were favored to reach it in safety on Third-day evening, the 27th:
since which my mind has been covered with peaceful quiet; an inestimable favor.
Soon after our return we were informed that what
I wrote to the prisoner had been handed to him,
and the sheriff hoped he would be benefitted thereby.

+++[+++It is no new thing for a testimony not to be received,
even when the messenger is Divinely commissioned.
The apostles who were sent out by their Heavenly Master were thus charged by Him:
"`Whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that city,
shake off the dust of your feet,`" etc.
A lively sense of the Redeemer`'s goodness and mercy,
a clear impression of the awfulness of eternity, a heart filled with love to Him,
and thence to all those, who, equally with themselves He died to save,
and as a crowning seal, a clear intimation that He requires such to go forth, thus,
and then, and there, will induce in those, who with true zeal desire to serve Him,
a cheerful sacrifice of home and the endearments of domestic life,
to proclaim that grace and truth which came by Him,
if so be they can but deliver their own souls, in the humble,
though earnest endeavor to exalt their glorious Lord`'s name and kingdom in the earth.
These may not be received, neither their testimony; though by their secret-seeing Father,
who looketh on the heart, and hath respect to the motive thereof,
the sacrifice may be accepted, and the peace of the servant be made to flow as a river.
But O! the solemnities of the dying hour to those who are
not brought to a sense of their sinful and lost condition,
as children of our fallen father,
nor to that "`godly sorrow which worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of.`"
No words can express the awfulness of the invisible world to these!
Having neglected His invitation, or done despite to the grace of their crucified,
but risen and glorified Saviour,
they are left without the needed support of His sustaining presence,
and the consolation of His ever blessed Spirit,
when summoned before that just judgment seat,
whose decisions shall be final and eternal.]

"`In the 11th month,`" she continues, "`I attended the Quarterly Meeting of Caln,
in company with my cousin James Emlen.
The life of Truth seemed at a low ebb there,
but a little ability was granted to labor for the arising of it.
We lodged on our way at our friend Charles Downing`'s,
where my mind was drawn into exercise, more especially towards his daughters,
which I endeavored to express in the ability vouchsafed;
and a peaceful feeling was experienced.
My feelings are often drawn out in desire for the preservation
of our dear young Friends in this day of trial.

"`On our way to Caln, I was attracted towards a small dwelling,
with a secret draught to see the inmates.
After crossing a large stream of water on a log,
and encountering some other difficulties, we got to it;
from whence we saw another small tenement,
the inmates of which were parents of the female head of the first one we got to.
These being sent for, soon came.
It seemed to me that some solemnity was felt; and after expressing what arose,
we were favored to return safely to the carriage, with, on my part, a relieved mind.
They were colored people; and some of them expressed much thankfulness for the visit.
I have on different occasions, sometimes by verbal communications,
and at others by writing, not mentioned in these notes,
felt my mind drawn in this way to families and individuals.
This, when it has been believed to be a Divine requiring,
and yielded to in the obedience of faith,
I have had cause to believe is one of the ways which my
Divine Master sees meet for me to be exercised in;
and although attended with close and deep searching of heart, and much in the cross,
yet I think I may say that my secret desire has been on these occasions,
to do the will of my Heavenly Father, without mixture of the creaturely part.
And now, while penning the foregoing, 5th of First month, 1851,
desires have been raised to the Father of mercies,
that He would be pleased to make me more pure, more acceptable in His sight.
Be pleased, O Lord! to enable me, day by day,
to look unto Thee for the knowledge of Thy blessed will,
and for strength to perform it the few remaining days of my lengthened out life.
And wilt Thou be pleased to be with me, thy unworthy creature,
in the solemn closing moments.

"`3rd month 12th, 1851.
Having been poorly for several days, which has afforded time for serious reflection,
I have been impressed with the need, we as a Society have,
of being more and more redeemed from the applause of men,
each one endeavoring with a single eye,
to attain to the mind of Truth respecting ourselves; taking that for our safe guide;
and not weakening our faith, and occasioning much conflict by looking outward.
Holy Father! be pleased to be with those in this day of sifting,
whose hearts are drawn unto Thee in fervent solicitude,
that thou wouldst spare thy people, and give not thine heritage to reproach.

"`6th month 8th. Having for some time felt drawn to attend
the Monthly Meetings constituting Caln Quarter,
with one or more of the particular meetings;
and obtaining the concurrence of our Monthly Meeting,
accompanied by +++_______+++ and +++_______+++,
I left home the 31st of Fifth month, and attended Bart meeting next day.
Way not opening with sufficient clearness to appoint a meeting on Second day,
we spent the time in visiting my dear widowed friend S. C. also a sick young woman,
L+++.+++ S., and some others.
Third day attended Sadsbury Monthly Meeting; the three following days, Bradford, Uwchlan,
and Robeson Monthly Meetings.
The life of religion appeared to me to be at a low ebb in most of them,
particularly the last named.
The language again and again presented while among Friends there,
'`How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!`' They are few in number,
and it seems as though the perishable things of this
life had so taken hold of their minds,
that the pure seed of the Kingdom is oppressed as a cart under sheaves.
It was a time of suffering;
but having endeavored to attend to the mind of Truth
in the course of the foregoing visit,
I was favored to return with the reward of peace.
We were absent one week.

"`Having been exercised at times latterly in the prospect of visiting
a young man in West Chester prison under sentence of death,
on the 6th of Seventh month, in company with my cousin J. E., I went to see him.
We felt a secret hope that the poor,
erring youth was in some degree sensible of his wickedness,
and fervent desires were raised that the work of repentance
might be more earnestly sought after by him;
and that it might be mercifully granted by the Lord Almighty,
whose mercy seat covers His judgment seat.

"`Having felt my mind at times, almost ever since we came to West Chester,
in bonds on account of a prospect of appointing a meeting on a First day afternoon,
for those who seem to be spending their time in the gratification of self,
too much forgetting the Lord that bought them;
and as the view was not confined to those of our own Society exclusively,
it felt to me the more weighty, even too mighty for me.
But the exercise increasing, and having the approbation of Friends,
a meeting was appointed in the afternoon of the 31st of Eighth month.
It was large,
and felt to me that a renewed visitation was extended
to some who had been feeding as on the husks;
who were tenderly entreated no longer to put by the heavenly visitor,
times and seasons being not at our command.
A solemn covering spread over the meeting,
under which I trust many minds were seriously impressed;
and after solemn supplication the meeting closed,
under a thankful sense of the renewed extension of heavenly kindness.
I was thus relieved from a weight which had long rested upon me.
May all the praise be ascribed unto Him, to whom alone it belongs.

"`9th month 28th. This day I have experienced, I trust,
more of the sustaining arm of Divine mercy than is often the case;
tending to renew my faith in the all-sufficiency of Holy Help,
causing desires to arise that I may be enabled to thank Him for His mercies past,
and humbly hope for a continuance thereof.

"`10th month 4th. I left home in company with my sister Edith Edge,
and brother Abraham Gibbons, to attend the funeral of my beloved cousin Ellis L. Pusey.
Sat with friends in their meeting at West Grove next day,--an exercising season to me;
apprehending there were some present who were building
a structure in their own will and wisdom,
which retarded their progress in becoming experimentally
acquainted with the Lord our Maker.
These were earnestly and tenderly entreated to become scholars in the school of Christ,
and learn of Him.
Supplication followed that they might be made sensible that
there were no joys equal to the joys of God`'s salvation.
I thought the meeting was favored with a solemn covering, and closed peacefully.
In the afternoon we attended the burial, which was large.
My mind was again exercised in desire,
that we who were present might feel it a solemn occasion, and the language presented,
'`Be ye also ready, for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh.`'

"`After leaving West Chester to attend the funeral of my cousin,
we heard of the decease of +++_______+++ at Wilmington,
whither I went on Second day morning, arriving there about eleven o`'clock.`"
She says some painful feelings attended her mind at this funeral,
and thus concludes the memorandum respecting it: "`Gracious God! be pleased,
I beseech Thee, to enable me, a poor unworthy worm of the dust,
to look unto Thee day by day, and to do Thy blessed will: that so the language may not,
in the winding up of time, be applicable to me, '`the harvest is past, the summer ended,
and I am not saved.`'`"

"`2nd month 1852.
I have entered my eighty-second year.
Attended our Quarterly Meeting at Concord.
Here our valued friend Mary Kite,
gave a satisfactory account of her religious visit to the Yearly Meeting of North Carolina,
and the meetings constituting it.

No date.
"`After having passed through much exercise,
in the prospect of having a meeting with the inmates of the Chester county poor-house,
my mind became impressed with the belief that it
would be right for me to be resigned to it;
and accordingly I mentioned the subject to the select members of our Monthly Meeting,
who encouraged me to attend to the prospect;
and after the needful arrangements were made,
and several Friends being willing to accompany me,
a meeting was held on First day afternoon, the 14th of Third month,
with the family and inmates, about two hundred in number,
much to the relief and satisfaction of my own mind.

"`4th month`" +++[+++Our dear friend, after stating, under this date,
that she had attended our Yearly Meeting, with some few remarks thereon, thus concludes:]
"`It is not likely I shall attend another annual assembly,
as the infirmities of age are pressing upon me.
Yet desires are raised,
that the hands of the laborers may be strengthened
by the mighty God of Jacob to do his work;
and that a succession of laborers may be raised up,
to support the precious doctrines and testimonies given to us as a people,
that Zion may again arise in her ancient beauty.`"

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++It is no marvel that the above Christian desire, coupled, it may be, with grave fears,
should be entertained by one in her measure, as was the prophet Elijah,
"`very jealous for the Lord God of hosts.`"
For, surely the hands of the laborers were never more ready to hang down through weakness,
nor the apprehension greater respecting a succession of faithful,
whole-hearted workmen and work-women true to the death, who, in humility, contrition,
and obedience, and in the power and life of a crucified yet risen and glorified Redeemer,
shall stand for the law and the testimony committed
to this people to bear before a world,
which would, if possible, rob them no less of their cross than of their crown.
How often is the query reiterated, "`By whom shall Jacob arise, for he is small?`"
But it is believed that the hands of the builders and burden-bearers,
now striving to turn the battle to the gate, would be much strengthened by the cheering,
consoling evidence,
that the dear young people as "`a succession of laborers,`" were
submitting themselves to that heavenly discipline of true self-denial
and the daily cross that the Saviour calls to;
which would train them for usefulness in their day and generation,
even to cause their hands to war, and their fingers to fight in that warfare, which,
while it is represented by the prophet,
as "`with burning and fuel of fire,`" is at the same time dignified with immortality,
and crowned with eternal life.
Thus early planted in the house of the Lord, such would flourish in the courts of our God.
They would not only be made fruitful in the field of offering,
and joyful in the house of prayer,
but be a strength and encouragement to those now bearing the burden and heat of the day;
and whose greatest joy would be to see sons and daughters in true self-renunciation,
walking in, and enjoying the exceeding riches of the Saviour`'s grace,
and the comfort of the Holy Ghost, unto the edification of the church,
the spouse and body of Christ.]

"`First day, the 20th. I attended our meeting at West Chester.
A solemnity seemed spread over us, wherein the secret petition of my heart was,
that we might be kept humble,
and given to know with holy certainty the voice of
the true Shepherd from that of the stranger,
and that every living desire begotten of the Most High after holiness,
without which no man shall see the Lord, might be cherished.
I thought the petition nearly ready for vocal utterance, when the meeting closed,
and left me in sadness.
But as it was not wilful disobedience, I trust that He, who knoweth our frame,
and remembereth we are but dust, will in mercy forgive;
and may I be helped to be more instant in season, is the present breathing of my spirit.

"`In the latter part of 8th month, I was unexpectedly brought under exercise,
on reading an account of a poor colored man in prison at Newcastle,
under sentence of death.
It seemed best to me that I should endeavor to see him; and after some time,
I was made willing to mention my exercise to the elders, who did not discourage me,
and suitable company offering, we left home on First day afternoon,
the 5th of Ninth month, and next morning proceeded to Newcastle,
and were readily admitted into the apartment where the prisoner was.
He appeared very uncomfortable as to the outward, but we were united in believing,
that his mind was turned to the right source for help and strength;
and that the work of repentance was in mercy going forward.
After endeavoring to obtain relief, both in testimony and supplication, for the poor man,
and dear M. having also something to communicate, we came homeward:
my mind being clothed with thankfulness for having
been enabled to yield to apprehended duty,
and for the reward of peace.

"`7th month 29th. In our Monthly Meeting, my dear friend, Mary Kite,
opened a concern to visit the families of West Chester Preparative Meeting.
A similar prospect having attended my mind for some time past,
at least to visit a part thereof, and Friends uniting there with,
we went in company with James Emlen and Martha Jefferis,
who were also liberated to accompany us.
My friends visited all the families, except a few who were not at home,
and I accompanied, as way opened, to the relief and satisfaction of my own mind.
Oh, the weightiness of visiting families!

"`11th month 10th, 1852.
In company with cousin James Emlen, I attended the funeral of A. T., an aged Friend,
and member of Bradford Meeting.
It was, as is often the case at funerals, a time of close exercise to me;
feeling it right to endeavor to turn the minds of the people
inward to the alone Source of help and strength,
in order to be prepared for the solemn close of life:
believing there are those in attendance sometimes at funerals,
who do not often or willingly go to any place of worship.
Towards such my feelings are often drawn while standing round the grave,
in very earnest solicitude, that they may improve the remaining time allotted them,
to their everlasting advantage; remembering that the High and Holy One hath declared,
His spirit should not always strive with man.
I was favored to return with some evidence of Divine regard.

"`1st month 16th, 1853.
This day twenty-one years ago, I with my dear children,
were numbered among the widows and fatherless;
and the prayer of my heart was on the solemn occasion, as it has often been since,
to Him who had been pleased to remove from me my outward stay and counsellor,
that He would be with me and mine, preserve us from all evil,
and enable us to walk in the way that pleased Him.
Many weary steps and painful feelings have been experienced in my widowed state,
sometimes under a sense of shortcomings and steppings aside out of the right way,
for want of more earnestly watching unto prayer.
Of late it has been a time as it were, of turning over the leaves of my life,
wherein many exercises, close provings and conflicts have been remembered,
when the silent language of my heart was with that of David:
"`Is his mercy clean gone forever?`"
Yet as faith and patience have been sought after,
He in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,
has been pleased in His own time to return with healing in his wings,
and my faith and hope have been renewed in the all-sufficiency of Divine support,
when the trust and hope have arisen,
'`surely goodness and mercy have followed me all the days
of my life.`' Gracious Father! be pleased to be with me;
guide and guard me through the few remaining steps of my life,
and enable me to do all Thy blessed will.
That thus I may be prepared, through Thy goodness and mercy, to receive the clean linen,
pure and white, the righteousness of saints;
and to enter that city whose walls are salvation, and whose gates are praise.

"`2nd month 16th. Close provings and besetments have been my portion of latter time;
wherein the enemy of my soul`'s peace has been permitted
to buffet and follow closely with doubts and fears,
lest I had through inadvertence, cast a stumbling block in the way of others,
and retarded my own eternal welfare.
This morning, before I arose, feeling a renewal of conflict and exercise, the secret,
inmost, earnest breathing of my spirit was to our Saviour,
that He would be pleased to afford a little of the
calming influence of His own good Spirit,
and give me to know His blessed will; when the language seemed impressively spoken,
'`Draw nigh unto God,
and he will draw nigh unto thee.`' And to the praise of His excellent name be it spoken,
He has in good measure calmed the troubled sea,
and given me renewedly to hope in his mercy and goodness.

"`4th month.
I attended our Yearly Meeting under much discouragement and lowness of mind,
and considerable infirmity of body.
The meeting was favored to proceed in the weighty concerns which came before it,
in more harmony than at some former annual gatherings.
It seemed as though the house of David was growing stronger and stronger,
and the house of Saul weaker and weaker;
yet there was cause for mourning on account of an
unsanctified ministry appearing in a few individuals.
May He who is the Head of His own church, work in us and for us,
until all that is offensive in His holy eyesight may be purged out;
and more of the calming, cementing influence of His blessed Spirit be felt to prevail,
and the body be edified in love.

"`5th month 5th. My mind has of latter time often been clothed with mourning,
provings and besetments; wherein the enemy has been permitted to come in as a flood,
and the need is often felt of increased watchfulness unto prayer.
But in our week-day meeting this morning, I became impressed with earnest desires,
that we might be more and more redeemed from the things which perish with the using,
and know an advancement in the high and holy way,
cast up for the ransomed and redeemed of the Lord to walk in;
and ability was afforded vocally to supplicate the Father of mercies for preservation,
and increased dedication to His blessed requirings.
I have since been favored with peaceful quiet, a heavenly treasure in the earthen vessel,
not at all at our command; yet more to be desired than the increase of corn, wine,
or oil.

"`6th month 12th. Poverty and leanness continue to be much my portion of late.
But going to meeting this morning in strippedness, and I trust true self-abasement,
desires were raised for a little of that bread which nourisheth the soul,
if consistent with the Divine will: when after a time,
the humble query of those whom our Divine Master called blessed, revived in my mind:
'`When saw we thee an hungered,`' etc., with the consoling answer,
'`Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,
ye did it unto me.`' The revival whereof seemed to have healing virtue in it,
for which I desire to be thankful.`"

'''

+++[+++It is the invariable way of our God to bring low, before He raiseth up;
that under the humiliating and painful sense of our unworthiness,
and that we are nothing, and have nothing, and can do nothing,
all our dependence may be upon Him alone.
The Psalmist saith: "`I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me,
and heard my cry.
He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay,
and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God.`"
It was thus,
out of poverty and weakness that our dear friend was made strong in the Lord,
and in the power of His might;
and from having the harp hung upon the willows in mournful silence,
to know it afresh tuned to the praise of Him who had delivered out of every temptation,
and preserved alive to the praise of His all-powerful grace.
Herein, what is written is verified: "`Thou hast wrought all our works in us:`" and,
"`All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee.`"]

'''

"`8th month 31st, Our Monthly Meeting at West Chester.
Our friends David and Debbie Cope attended it.
The former was acceptably engaged in testimony and supplication.
It seemed to me a time wherein it might be said there was
a harmonizing together in labor for Truth`'s honor;
a favor which being by no means at our command,
claims our humble gratitude to the Author of all good.

"`9th month 2nd. Notwithstanding I have made so few
entries of this kind for nearly three months,
yet I think I may say in truth,
my mind has been daily desirous to be enabled to walk acceptably before the Most High,
and of latter time, has been more preserved in the quiet than for some time before;
and at seasons a little of that bread handed, which is precious:
confirming in the belief, that '`the name of the Lord is a strong tower,
whereunto the righteous flee and find safety.`'

"`28th. Having for a considerable time felt exercised in the prospect
of visiting the families of Uwchlan Monthly Meeting,
I was today liberated for the service.
My beloved friend Martha Jefferis, being willing to accompany me, it was also united with.

"`10th month 6th. We attended Uwchlan Monthly Meeting;
wherein our friends William Trimble and Charles Downing were appointed to accompany us.
The service was indeed weighty,
and the necessity of keeping the eye single to Him whom I believed had put us forth,
was never more pressingly felt than on the present occasion.
The families were about forty in number,
and the visit was performed under much bodily infirmity:
yet we were enabled to proceed from day to day to its conclusion;
when I was favored with the reward of peace, far surpassing all earthly enjoyments.
Gracious Father! be pleased, I beseech thee, to keep me in the straight and narrow way;
and enable me from time to time to render unto Thee that which is Thy due,
thanksgiving and praise.

"`Not long after the foregoing visit was performed,
I went to see my dear son and family at Coatesville,
I distributed some tracts on religious subjects while in the neighborhood.
Also called at a house on the way, to which I felt a little drawn,
and left some of the same, which appeared to be well received.
After spending nearly a week with my dear children, grand children and other connections,
and visiting S. L., who is in declining health,
I was favored to return home without condemnation.

"`11th month 2nd. Our friends, Samuel Leeds, and William and Elizabeth Evans,
attended our Monthly Meeting, held at West Chester.
Their company and religious labors were acceptable and edifying.
May fruits be brought forth to the praise of the Great and Good Husbandman,
adequate to the manifold favors received, is the present breathing of my spirit.

"`12th month 18th. First-day.
On sitting down in our meeting, I was early impressed with the importance,
of not only presenting the body before the High and Holy One,
but of being brought into stillness before Him; which we cannot attain to,
in our own will and time.
In the feeling of my own nothingness, and in ability to do any good thing,
I was led to crave preservation,
and to be made quick of understanding in the fear of the Lord;
that so I might not become as the withered branch,
or as the salt that had lost its savor: which I sometimes greatly fear.

"`2nd month 26th, 1854.
First day.
Though feeble in body, I was favored to get to meeting; and on sitting down,
a comfortable solemnity seemed to be spread over us:
which I trust was more general than at some other times.
The greatness and goodness of Him whom we had met to worship, and our feeble state,
were livingly brought before me,
attended with an humbling sense of our blessed Saviour`'s declaration,
'`Without me ye can do nothing.`' Desires were raised for the continuance of His mercy;
and that He would be pleased so to interpose,
in seasons of close conflict and besetment with His tribulated children,
as to put the armies of the aliens to flight; strengthening their faith,
and enabling them from time to time to pursue the
path which He is pleased to open before them,
with holy alacrity.
It was a time of renewed favor to me, which I desire to have in grateful remembrance;
more especially as poverty and strippedness, with doubts and fears,
had been much my portion for some time before.
Gracious Father, be pleased I beseech thee,
to keep me from casting away my confidence in Thee,
Thou ever blessed Shepherd and Bishop of souls.`"

'''

+++[+++Truly noticeable and interesting is the fact, how steadily engaged Hannah Gibbons was,
to keep close to the Lord in reverential prayer.
From Him, the great Counsellor in the heart, who teacheth as never man taught,
she realized a wisdom profitable to direct unto every good word and work.
These secret aspirations, and turning our thoughts in humility, and,
it may be in silence to heaven and heavenly things,
is what draws from our secret-seeing Father,
the blessing of instruction and preservation; of life and of peace.
Herein He communes with us, through the still small voice of His Spirit,
saying in our hearts, this is the way, walk thou in it,
when we would turn to the right hand or to the left.

Oh! that our hearts were more poured out in secret supplication, panting,
as the hart for the water-brook,
after the well-spring of life which Christ Jesus only can give.
Then should we be permitted more often,
and more richly to partake of those streams which make glad the whole heritage of God.
Is not all that is wanting, a teachable, and contrite, humble spirit,
with that hunger and thirst after righteousness which
our heavenly Shepherd has pronounced blessed:
saying, "`they shall be filled.`"?

Then may we, after the example of this faithful handmaiden of her Lord,
watch unto prayer with all perseverance.
May every trial send us to this great resource of the christian.
Not pharisaically, or in any way that looks like ostentation, but in secret, wrestling,
importuning entreaty.
This sort of humiliation and prayer is the life of all we do.
This enables to keep close to the Lord as little dependent children;
and to such He will be a God nigh at hand.
He will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax;
but will be graciously pleased to verify to these His ancient promises,
"`If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, and it shall be given.`"
"`Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee,
and thou shalt glorify me.`"

The subjoined letter to her friend William Evans, was written about this time, viz:]

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

[.signed-section-context-open]
2nd or 3rd month 1854.

[.salutation]
My dear friend William Evans,

Thy acceptable letter was duly received, and has been frequently read,
being found answering as face doth face in a glass.
Oh! the buffetings and besetments which the poor soul is at times permitted
to experience from the cruel one! wherein there is no safe resting place
but in endeavoring to keep the eye of the mind single unto Him,
who was tempted in all points as we are, and yet without sin.
He alone knows how to succor those who are tempted,
and I believe will in seasons of this kind,
as there is a cleaving close unto Him in faith and patience, make way for our escape,
enabling the poor, tribulated, humbled mind to adopt the language,
'`the name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it,
and are safe.`' Desires are raised that we may not be suffered to cast
away our confidence in the unfailing arm of Israel`'s Shepherd.
I think I often see our standing to be as on a sea of glass;
wherein great is the necessity of watching unto prayer.
Here there is no time to be idle, lest, as formerly, while men sleep the enemy sow tares.
Truly it is a day when he is very busy,
striving to draw the mind away from the pure and simple Truth as it is in Jesus,
and persuading the unwary that there is an easier way to the kingdom of heaven,
than by self-denial and the daily cross.
Oh! may such be given to believe that the enemy of
all righteousness was a liar from the beginning,
and continues to be so.
May these have their minds drawn to that foundation which standeth sure;
against which the gates of hell shall not be able to prevail.

It was pleasant to find your evening meetings had been held to satisfaction.
I often thought of thee and dear Elizabeth,
not doubting but that you felt much exercise and responsibility,
attended with desire for their being held to profit.
When I was a child and had the privilege of attending them,
I often thought they were good meetings;
and I doubt not they have been seasons blessed to many,
even as bread cast upon the waters.
It may be also, and I trust has been so,
to some who do not attend Friends`' meetings in the day time.
I have often had to remember the language of our blessed Saviour, '`Other sheep I have,
which are not of this fold:`' and if the little few who remain in our poor Society,
that may be comparable to the '`remnant of Jacob`' '`in the midst
of many people,`' keep their habitations in the blessed Truth,
I have believed, and continue to believe, that there will be a gathering unto them,
and strength will be renewed to journey forward in
the ever-blessed cause of truth and righteousness.
I unite with you in the hope,
that a change of feeling has taken place in the minds
of individual members of our Yearly Meeting:
that more of a disposition prevails to look at things deliberately and in calmness;
and as this disposition increases, I believe that of alienation will decrease,
and there will be more of a seeing eye to eye,
more of a harmonizing together for the honor of Truth.
That this may be our happy experience as a body, is often the breathing of my spirit.

The extract from dear A. Clarke`'s letter was cordial to my mind:
and O! that her cheering prospect may be realized,--a belief that the day is
not far distant when the true followers of the Lamb will be greatly increased, etc.
Her concluding remarks are very similar to what have been my own impressions.
But how things are to come to an amicable and harmonious issue,
we must leave with the Judge of all the earth, who will do right.
I now unexpectedly remember some expressions of worthy, deceased Richard Jordan:
'`Oh! the excellence,`' said he, '`of patient, quiet suffering.`'
Our Yearly Meeting is fast approaching.
Whether I shall get there is uncertain,
feeling the infirmities of increasing age pressing upon me,
and as if home is the best place for me.
Yet I desire that those who are permitted to assemble,
may so experience the solemnizing power of Truth to prevail,
that the spirit which is not of it, may be kept down,
and the pure Truth exalted over all, to the comfort of the heavy-hearted,
whose desire is that Zion may arise, shake herself from the dust of the earth,
and put on her beautiful garments.

"`3rd month 1854.
I believe I may say of a truth that my mind is daily exercised
in desire that the day`'s work may keep pace with the day;
and that there may not be a relaxing or growing lukewarm
in the work of the soul`'s salvation.

"`Having felt drawn towards a family, members of our Society,
who are about to remove from among Friends, with their tender offspring,
I thought it seemed best to propose having an opportunity with them.
This being approved,
and my beloved friends James Emlen and Martha Jefferis being willing to accompany me,
we accordingly sat with the family on the evening
of the 24th. It was a time of close exercise;
but as I endeavored in simplicity to express that which seemed given,
my mind was after a little time, favored to settle down in peaceful quiet.

"`26th. First-day afternoon I went, accompanied by my daughter, to see +++_______+++.
We found her apparently near the confines of the grave;
and I felt a hope that the spirit was about to return to God who gave it.
I thought there was a solemnity felt;
and my mind being drawn towards a young man in the family,
though altogether a stranger to me,
I ventured to express a few words on taking leave of him,
on the necessity of preparation for the solemn close of this life,
which afforded solemn satisfaction.
Gracious Father! wilt thou be pleased to keep me in the
straight and narrow way which leadeth unto Thee,
Thou King of saints.

"`4th month.
Our Yearly Meeting occurring, I was favored to get to nearly all the sittings of it.
It was more satisfactory than any we have had of latter years:
and the Blessed Head of the church condescended in
mercy to overshadow the assembly at seasons,
with the solemnizing influence of His own blessed Spirit,
to the comfort and refreshment of many minds;
and Friends were favored to transact the weighty
business of the meeting in a good degree of harmony.
Indeed it felt to me a time wherein we had cause to thank God and take courage.

"`After Yearly Meeting my daughter J. and I went to Germantown
on a visit to my sister Edith Edge and family.
Her son T., being in declining health, it was grateful to me to be with them,
and share in their affliction.
The dear youth was, in a few days after we left them, taken to his final resting place;
and I trust was gathered in mercy.

"`28th. In company with my daughter J., I attended the funeral of our friend.
It was a time of close exercise to my poor mind; and the day being wet and unpleasant,
added to the difficulty of getting about.
Truly my infirmities press more and more upon me.
I went under discouragement,
but to the praise of the Lord`'s excellent name be it spoken,
I was favored to return with peaceful feelings.

"`4th month 30th, 1854.
Today our dear friend, Martha Jefferis departed this life.
She was one who had been engaged to have her day`'s work done in the day time.
Her last illness was of nearly a week`'s continuance;
in the course of which she said the event was much hidden from her;
but she felt that her blessed Saviour was near.
Thus in great sweetness, without struggle or apparent pain,
she gently ceased to breathe, about noon.
She was a useful member of Society, and will be much missed among us.
May the Lord of the harvest bring forth laborers into His harvest,
is the present breathing of my spirit.

Same date.
"`Our valued friend B. H. from Ohio, in the course of his religious visit in these parts,
attended our meeting at West Chester.
It was a time of renewed favor;
and oh! that fruits answerable thereto may be brought forth,
that so we may not become as the fruitless fig-tree, of which it was said, '`cut it down,
why cumbereth it the ground.`'

"`5th month.
I attended our Quarterly Meeting at Concord.
At the same time I thought much of Caln and Western Quarters:
but not feeling it a duty required, and the infirmities of age pressing upon me,
I felt easy to remain at home.
Gracious Father! be pleased to be near me, unworthy as I am;
and preserve me from going before,
or loitering behind the guidance of Thy blessed Spirit:
that so I may be made quick of understanding in Thy fear.

"`7th month 9th. Soon after taking my seat in our meeting today,
desires were raised that we might be individually benefitted by thus coming together;
that our minds might be turned more and more inward to the
gift of grace which teacheth as never man taught.
The exercise continuing to press upon me, with a pointing to express it,
I ventured to do so, according to my feeble ability;
and believing that the spirit of supplication was felt,
it was vocally uttered in awfulness and holy fear.
After which I was favored with peaceful quiet.

"`8th month 24th. I attended our week-day meeting, after an absence of nearly a month,
from indisposition.
My heart was early humbled,
and brought under exercise with desires for the preservation of the beloved youth;
and believing it right to express a few words for their encouragement,
I did so in broken sentences;
and was favored the remaining part of the meeting with a comfortable calm.
But after returning home, I was beset with doubts and fears,
lest there had been a moving in the awful work without
sufficient evidence of its being a Divine requiring;
under the exercise whereof, I could appeal to the Searcher of hearts,
Thou knowest I have never ventured to speak in Thy
name without believing it to be required by Thee,
unfit and unworthy as I am!
After which my feelings became more quiet, in believing that these conflicting,
searching seasons were designed for my deepening in the root of life.

"`9th month 10th. Our meeting today was small,
and to me it seemed like toiling all night and catching nothing, or at least but little.
As to the outward it was a day of favor: being one of rain,
after a time of unusual heat and drought,
whereby vegetation is much parched and dried up.
Oh!
I often thought during the dry time,
how much we have to remind us of our very great dependence
on Him from whom we receive every blessing,
both spiritual and temporal.

"`11th month.
I attended our Quarterly Meeting at Concord;
which seemed to require considerable exertion in my feeble state.
Yet while out I was favored, in company with Mary Kite, to get to see S. T.,
who is in declining health.
It was to me a satisfactory visit,
believing that the mind of the dear young man was preparing
for the solemn event which appeared to await him.
His dear, afflicted, widowed mother, sat with us;
to whom tender sympathy and encouragement was felt and expressed.
What a mercy it is that though our Heavenly Father
is pleased to afflict the children of men,
yet He does not forsake those who put their trust in Him.
After leaving a few tracts at a house on our way home,
for a man whom I saw at work in the road the day before,
I was favored to return with a quiet mind, free from condemnation.

"`23rd. Our dear friend, Mary Kite, attended our week-day meeting,
and appeared in solemn supplication.
It seemed to me to be a time of renewing of covenant with some,
perhaps of the dear young people.
May they be enabled to keep them by His holy aid;
who alone is able to help us to keep our covenants with Him.

"`I recently attended the funeral of R. W. L. It was a close
bereavement to her dear daughters M. I. G. and I. P. H.;
and it seemed to me a solemn time, wherein the necessity for us who remain,
to be ready for the like solemn change, was deeply impressed on my mind.
It seemed best for me, I thought, to call the attention of the people,
both at the house and while standing about the grave, to this all important concern.
Oh! may I on every succeeding occasion,
when apprehending myself called upon to speak in the name of the Most High,
let the solemn query come close home, is '`woe unto me if I preach not the gospel.`'?

"`2nd month 11th, 1855.
It has been for some time past a season of much poverty of spirit,
attended with sadness and mourning on account of the state of our poor Society;
wherein the language hath often arisen, '`spare thy people, O Lord,
and give not thine heritage to reproach.`' At other
times the aspirations of my heart have been,
Lord help us, for vain is the help of man;
and also that I may be enabled to bear my allotted
portion of suffering for the Body`'s sake;
and be more and more concerned to know the will of Him whom I desire to serve,
as well as have strength to perform it: and I may add,
that it seemed this day in our meeting,
as though my mental breathings to the Father of mercies had nearer access to Him,
than at many other seasons.
May I be thankful for every gleam of His condescending goodness and mercy.

"`4th month 8th. In our meeting today,
poverty and heaviness was the clothing of my spirit for a considerable time;
and in striving to obtain a little of that wisdom which is profitable to direct aright,
my mind was renewedly and solemnly impressed with the awfulness of the standing
of those who feel called upon publicly to proclaim the name of the Lord,
while in themselves, without Christ Jesus, they are nothing:
and while I was exercised in desire to stand acquitted in the Divine sight,
the following passage of Holy Writ revived: '`I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem,
by the roes and by the hinds of the field,
that ye stir not up nor awake my love until he please:
which renewedly gave me to see the necessity of patient waiting,
until the evidence of Divine requiring is clear.
In the prospect of attending our approaching Yearly Meeting, fearfulness covers my mind,
on account of the unsettled state of our Society.

"`16th, our Yearly Meeting commenced; and I attended most of its sittings.
Some of them were painful seasons;
yet notwithstanding our backslidings and many departures from the simple truth,
the last sitting was favored with a comfortable degree of solemnity;
furnishing a hope that the Shepherd of Israel is
still watching over his church with compassion,
and would heal our backslidings if we were sufficiently humble.

"`29th. In our meeting today, a solemnity seemed spread over us,
and after considerable searching of heart,
a few words I thought were required to be vocally expressed; which being yielded to,
solemn supplication was afterwards poured forth.
It felt to me a time of renewed favor, wherein my heart was made glad,
and fresh cause given to trust in Him from whom cometh all our sure mercies.

"`5th month 13th, 1855.
It seemed to me in our meeting today, as at other times,
that there are a number of seeking individuals, that attend with us on First-days,
who are not members of our religious Society.
For such I have craved, that their minds may not be outward,
but that they may be turned inward, where availing prayer is wont to be made;
that so they may be taught by our blessed Saviour
who condescends at seasons to teach his people Himself.
Earnest desires were also felt for our poor scattered Society, the church,
that through the powerful cleansing operation of the Holy Ghost and fire,
she may be brought out of her present wilderness state, clear as the sun,
fair as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners.

"`7th month.
22nd. Since the foregoing date I have been much afflicted with varied ailments,
from which I suffered much acute pain; yet through the goodness of the Lord,
I was kept in a good degree of quiet resignation;
and at seasons an evidence was granted that I was not cast off,
but was still regarded by Him, who careth for the sparrow.
May I be kept humble and grateful in the remembrance of it.
I have been at meeting today, the third time since my recovery.
It seemed to me, the condescending goodness of Israel`'s Shepherd was spread over us,
and an invitation went forth to those who may be standing at a distance, to come,
taste and see for themselves, through holy submission to the Lord`'s will,
that He is good, and that '`it is better to be a doorkeeper in his house,
than a dweller in the tents of wickedness.`'

"`8th month 12th. Our beloved friend S. Hillman,
attended our meeting on her way to Westtown school, and Concord Quarterly Meeting.
I thought her service with us, was attended with a precious feeling.

"`19th. It seemed to me we had a good meeting, in silence this morning.
May all the praise be given to Him, to whom alone it belongs.`"

8th month 28th, 1855.

[.salutation]
My dear friend, William Evans,

Although I feel but little ability to use the pen (indeed my ability is small
at any time) yet feel inclined to acknowledge the reception of thy welcome letter,
wherein a hope was renewed that all is not lost which may seem in danger.
I have never been without the hope that our poor Society will not be utterly laid waste,
believing there are a few in the different places who may be compared
to the remnant of Jacob in the midst of many people,
as a dew from the Lord.
As these are faithful to their Divine Leader,
striving through His aid to uphold the excellent
testimonies given to us as a people to bear,
I trust they in the Lord`'s time, will be brought to see eye to eye;
to walk by the same rule, and to mind the same thing;
and to be built up a spiritual house to the praise of His excellent Name.
In this day of unsettlement and close proving, the language often arises,
Study to be quiet, and mind thine own business.
If this concern was more generally prevalent amongst us, a high professing people,
there would be less time and inclination to dwell upon the faults of others.
Oh how busy the evil one is sowing tares which seem to be springing up abundantly,
to the great detriment of the weighty wheat.
Will not the Lord arise for the help of His people; they who have none in heaven but Him,
nor in the earth in comparison of Him?
Yea, I trust He will in His own time arise for the deliverance of these.

I unite with thee in believing that if the spirit of supplication
was lived in by the members universally--and it is the duty of
all--our hearts would be softened towards one another,
and that mercy which we crave for ourselves would be sought for others also.
How often have I desired that this kind of feeling might more prevail amongst us.
It would, I believe, do more for us than any mere instrumental means,
or all the separations that can be devised by man.
This is a day of suffering to many;
and I am sometimes grieved to find so much impatience in some to endure it,
accompanied with such a desire for separation, hoping thereby, I suppose,
to experience relief, without, it is to be apprehended,
sufficiently considering the importance of the step in the first place.
It is indeed sorrowful that so much disunity should prevail as to cause it,
whereby sad and heart-rending feelings are experienced,
not only in meetings and neighborhoods,
but also in some instances it descends to families;
very different indeed to the comfort which is at seasons
experienced by the disciples of our blessed Saviour,
who we profess to be followers of.
May patience more and more abound amongst the members of our poor unsettled Society,
and may He who can turn the heart as a man turneth the water-course in his field,
be pleased to take the work into His own hand, and then, who shall let it?

I was glad to hear of your Quarterly Meeting.
What a favor it is after a season of desertion and discouragement,
to be permitted to feel a little of the breaking of bread amongst us,
by which the pure mind is strengthened and encouraged
to persevere in the tribulated path,
trusting in Him who giveth power to the faint,
and to them that have no might He increaseth strength.

I am sometimes comforted in the belief that there are a number who meet with us on First-days,
not in membership, who are seeking the blessed Truth for themselves;
reviving the language, '`Other sheep have I not of this fold: them also will I bring,
and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd.`'

My late indisposition, from which I did not desire nor expect to be restored,
was attended with much suffering;
but through unmerited mercy my mind was kept for the most part, in quiet resignation,
and at seasons I thought an evidence was granted, that I, poor and unworthy as I am,
was not cast off by Him who careth for the sparrows--an unspeakable mercy,
which I desire to have in grateful and thankful remembrance.
My head continues in a weak state, and I am not able to write much at a time,
yet there seemed an obligation with me of grateful
acknowledgment for our being remembered by you,
my beloved brother and sister in the Truth.
With much love to dear Elizabeth and thyself, in which my J. unites,

[.signed-section-closing]
I remain your sincere friend,

"`9th month 23rd.`" After an allusion to a season of strippedness and poverty,
she thus continues: "`Through the condescending of our heavenly Shepherd,
my mind became impressed early in our meeting this morning with solemnity;
and desires were renewedly raised for our spiritual advancement
in the straight and narrow way which leads to life and peace.
The expression of it seemed required; and also to supplicate the Father of mercies,
that He would be pleased to extend the crook of His love,
even to those who had strayed from his house: and that He would make them sensible,
that in it there is bread enough and to spare.
My mind now enjoys a peaceful quiet, for which I desire to be renewedly thankful to Him,
who, when he opens none can shut, and when he shuts none can open.

"`11th month 4th. My dwelling is often in low places;
poverty and leanness being much my portion,
wherein doubts and fears often arise lest I have offended my gracious Master.
But Thou,
O Lord! knowest my departures from thy requirings
have been more from a fear of going too fast,
and that it should be said unto me, Who hath required this at thy hands;
than from wilful disobedience.

"`12th month 16th. I went to meeting in fear and care lest a wandering mind,
or a drowsy spirit, should gain the ascendency: but after a season of close labor,
He who can alone help his feeble children, was pleased to afford a little help,
and I was given to see renewedly and impressively,
that it is only by the aid of our merciful Heavenly Father,
that we are enabled to work out our soul`'s salvation.
Oh, then the need of watchfulness unto prayer!
Many passages of Scripture were brought to my remembrance for my own instruction I believe,
as no command was felt to offer them to others.

"`3rd month 23rd, 1856.
For sometime past, I have for the most part,
experienced such a state of strippedness and poverty,
as has caused much searching of heart, with the query, why is it so?
The silent language of my spirit also frequently was to the Father of mercies,
'`Cast me not off in the time of old age:
forsake me not when my strength faileth.`' These seasons of poverty and desertion,
I believe, are intended for our instruction in the heavenward journey;
giving us to feel our entire dependence; and that without Divine aid we can do nothing.
Yet this day my mind was renewed and quickened with desire, early in the meeting,
for the welfare and preservation of the youth present, and ability was given I believe,
to supplicate for those who were seeking pleasure in their outward enjoyments,
that they might be given to see the unsatisfying nature of them,
and their hearts be turned unto Him in whom alone there are substantial joys;
for those also who had been delaying the important work of the soul`'s salvation,
even until it might be the eleventh hour.
Supplication was put up to the Father of mercies
that they might be enabled to lay aside every weight,
and every burden, and the sins that so easily beset them,
and cleave unto Him who alone is able to strengthen them
to walk in the paths of regeneration and newness of life.
Afterwards it seemed right for me to stand on my feet and extend a tender invitation
to the beloved youth to yield to the visitations of heavenly good;
to be willing to take up the cross,
and follow their blessed Saviour in the way of His leadings;
that so they might be prepared in the closing moments of time,
to enter that city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is the Lord.
My mind this afternoon enjoys a comfortable quiet,
for which I desire to be thankful to Him, whose ways are not as our ways,
and whose dispensations are all in inscrutable wisdom.`"

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++After the perusal of such a memorandum, who can but exclaim,
O the desirableness of being followers of those who are followers of Christ--those who,
through faith and patience, inherit the promises!

May our dear young friends by the example before us,
be also afresh animated to diligence and faithfulness in dedicating themselves wholly,
body, soul, and spirit, to the Lord of life and glory who has bought them,
so as with full purpose of heart to walk as He enjoins,
in the narrow way of self-denial and the daily cross,
unto holiness of life and conversation.
Such He will then acknowledge and honor; make His yoke easy to, and His burden light;
cause His face to shine upon them and give them peace.
Surely there are no joys at all to be compared to those which the dear Redeemer,
in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,
and who hath all power in heaven and in earth, gives to those, who, as little children,
are willing to yield themselves to the precious influences of His Spirit,
and in self-renunciation, to sit patiently at His feet to hear His word.
These He will sweetly gather, as a hen doth her brood under her wing;
will carry in His bosom; preserve from evil that it may not grieve them;
and enable to grow in grace, and in the knowledge that is of, and to, and through Him,
unto eternal life.
These, through heavenly kindness, will experience His ways to be ways of pleasantness,
and all His paths to be peace: and that, "`In His presence there is fulness of joy;
at His right hand there are pleasures forevermore.`"
Would that this class, with fixedness of purpose and holy resolution, might choose,
with a wise ruler in ancient Israel,
"`rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;
esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt:
for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.`"]

"`5th month 4th, 1856.
Our friend S. M., from Ohio, and her companion,
attended our meeting in the course of their religious visit.
I could not hear dear S.`'s communication to us,
but I thought it was attended with a precious feeling; and her humble deportment,
with that of her companions, was to me encouraging.

"`11th. Today when it seemed almost time for meeting to close,
supplication was put up to the Father of mercies for continued favors,
and I thought the meeting ended under a solemn covering.
Gracious Father! be pleased to keep those who are endeavoring, though feebly,
to espouse Thy precious cause, as in the hollow of Thy holy hand.

"`6th month 8th. I thought we had a good meeting in silence.
It seemed to me the solemnity was more generally felt than is often the case;
wherein the language sweetly arose,
'`I will guide thee with mine eye.`' May my dependence
be ever on Him who doeth all things well:
who '`knoweth our frame and remembereth that we are dust.`'

"`8th month 27th. The day of our Monthly Meeting.
The forepart of it I thought was favored with a solemn covering in silence.
At the close of that for discipline, after a few words were spoken by way of testimony,
dear M. Kite appeared in solemn supplication.
Thankfulness was the clothing of my spirit.

"`1st month 4th, 1857.
Poverty and mourning have been much the clothing of my spirit of latter time;
partly perhaps because of the divisions in our poor Society,
which are much to be lamented.
Wilt thou be pleased, O Lord, to undertake for us?
for vain is the help of man.
I thought I was enabled in meeting today to labor for a
portion of that bread which nourisheth the inner man,
being never more sensible that it is not at our command;
and though not permitted to partake of much, yet my trust in Thee, O Father,
is not shaken!
Be pleased to enable me to hold fast my confidence in Thee,
even unto the end of my pilgrimage.

"`8th month 2nd. Since the foregoing date,
it hath pleased Divine wisdom to afflict me with a severe spell of sickness,
from which I did not expect to recover.
Notwithstanding poverty was often the clothing of my spirit,
there were seasons of sweet consolation,
wherein a hope was afforded that I was still under the notice of Him who
regards the workmanship of his own Almighty Hand with tender compassion:
which feeling I desire to have in grateful remembrance.
Being now so recovered as to be able to sit up most of the day,
the frequent breathing of my spirit is to the Father of mercies,
that He would be pleased to keep me from evil, in thought, word, or deed;
feeling increasingly the need of watchfulness unto prayer,
that I may be preserved from bringing dishonor on the blessed Truth.
I am now in the 87th year of my age.

"`A week ago our beloved friend W. G., from Ireland,
in the course of his religious visit to this land,
had an appointed meeting at West Chester; which I, with considerable assistance,
was enabled to attend.
A degree of thankfulness was felt in being permitted again
to assemble with my friends in order for Divine worship:
and though I could hear but very little of what was communicated,
I thought we had a good meeting;
and dear W.`'s company at our house afterwards was
strengthening to my often drooping mind.
'`Oh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness,
and for his wonderful works to the children of men.`'

"`11th month 8th. For several successive meetings, I have been able to attend regularly,
which I esteem a favor.
I was more comforted in that held today than at many other times,
in silently endeavoring to keep near to Divine counsel,
and free from intruding thoughts which often beset me;
and the prevailing desire of my mind was for myself and those assembled,
that we might be increasingly concerned to look to the High
and Holy One for strength to live the life of the righteous,
that so our latter end might be like unto theirs;
being renewedly sensible that any efforts in our creaturely wisdom would be unavailing.`"

+++[+++Hannah Gibbons often commemorates the goodness of her Heavenly Father,
in over-shadowing the silent meeting with His sweet, consoling presence.
It is this heavenly canopy, whether it be of the two or the three,
or the larger assembly, whether it be the silent sitting together,
or that wherein the command is given "`speak to my
people,`" that constitutes the christian`'s joy;
that binds up his wounds;
and enables to rejoice in the Lord and to joy in the God of his salvation.
Unless the Minister of ministers presides in a religious gathering, poor must they be,
despite every unsanctified effort to make them interesting or instructive.
It is the power from on High that is to be sought and waited for: while He,
who alone can give it, will forever make good His promises to the wrestling, longing,
patient soul: "`They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.`"

[.signed-section-context-open]
1st month 1858.

[.salutation]
My dear friend and brother,

My mind is often turned towards thee and dear Elizabeth,
in desire that neither heights nor depths, things present nor to come,
may be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
These are days of tribulation and sorrow;
yet it is a comfort to remember that the Lord`'s
arm is not shortened that it cannot save,
neither is His ear grown heavy that it cannot hear the cries of the poor,
and the sighings of the needy soul.
I am a little encouraged at times in the hope, that the work is on the wheel.
Is there not cause to hope that some things which are developing may have
a tendency to raise serious reflection in the minds of some?
Oh how much there is which has a tendency to divide and scatter,
instead of healing and binding up!

The desire of my poor feeble mind at times is,
that each one may do with their might what their hands find to do,
in order for the repairing of the walls which are so lamentably broken down:
and as these honestly endeavor to go forth in humility and godly fear,
I trust the work will prosper, though they may have as it were, to work with one hand,
while they hold a weapon of defence in the other.
I trust there are in different places, a tribulated, suffering remnant,
who as they endeavor to keep the faith and the patience,
will in the Lord`'s time know Him to arise for their help,
remembering the encouraging language, '`Fear not, little flock,
it is your Father`'s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.`'

Yesterday our little select Preparative Meeting was held.
As we sat together, the saying of our blessed Saviour revived in my mind:
'`Where two or three are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the midst of them.`' It seemed to me that there was
a little of the heavenly influence felt amongst us;
which is cause of humble gratitude to the Author of all good,
and encouraging to the traveller Zionward.

"`2nd month 7th. Being favored to get to meeting today,
the language early revived in my remembrance, '`I will bear the indignation of the Lord,
because I have sinned against him;`' which continued to impress my mind,
attended with desires that those who had departed from the right way of the Lord,
might patiently bear His chastenings, in order for their purification,
until He was pleased to say, It is enough: and through all,
experience that repentance which is the gift of God.
I feared to omit endeavoring to express my exercise, lest I might fall into condemnation:
but Oh! the weightiness of speaking in the name of the Lord;
it has felt increasingly awful to me of latter time.

"`8th. This day I have entered my 88th year;
and desires have been raised that increasing watchfulness
unto prayer may be sought after;
and in the remembrance of many favors which I have received,
a degree of thankfulness was felt,
attended with solicitude for a continuance of the Lord`'s mercies,
if it be His blessed will, the few remaining days allotted me.

"`6th month 20th. I went to meeting,
under some sense of the importance of attending our meetings in a right manner,
being sometimes tried with unprofitable thoughts,
and at others with heaviness and dullness;
feeling sensible also of our entire inability to worship the Father aright,
without His holy assistance.
I had not sat long before my mind was impressed with desire
for the encouragement of those who feel their own nothingness,
and the language arose: For the oppression of the poor,
and the sighing of the needy soul, I will arise, saith the Lord.
Supplication was put up for those,
and also for such as were delaying the important work of the soul`'s salvation;
and a few words being afterwards expressed in testimony, though feeble in body,
my mind was favored with an holy quiet,
which I desired to have in grateful remembrance.`"

No date.
"`I attended the funeral of my beloved cousin R.
A+++.+++ It seemed to me a solemn time at the grave;
a season I trust wherein renewed visitation was extended to some,
who were earnestly entreated not again to put by the offers of Divine mercy,
remembering the awful declaration of the Most High,
'`My spirit shall not always strive with man.`' I returned peaceful and thankful.
Dear Hannah Rhoads was in attendance, and was favored in testimony.`"

[.signed-section-context-open]
10th month 2nd and 3rd, 1858.

[.salutation]
My dear friend William Evans,

I feel inclined to write thee a few lines,
though as usual have but little ability for it,
more than to acknowledge thy kind remembrance of me, dated the first of last month.
Communications of that kind, from those who love the Lord Jesus,
seem to me comparable to iron sharpening iron to the weary traveller,
such as have often to adopt the language,
'`surely I am a worm and no man.`' These humiliating seasons
are no doubt designed for our deepening in the root of life,
whereby we are brought to feel the verity of the declaration, Of yourselves, without Me,
ye can do nothing.
I would that feelings of this kind did more generally prevail amongst us as a Society;
causing us to study to be quiet, and to do our own business,
each one endeavoring in humility and godly fear to build over against his own house,
in order for the rebuilding of the walls which are so lamentably broken down.
Truly the saying of our blessed Lord is applicable:
'`He that is not with me is against me;
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.`'

The breathing of my heart often is, Lord help us, for vain is the help of man.
What a mercy it is that through all the shaking permitted,
'`the foundation of God standeth sure; having this seal,
the Lord knoweth them that are his:`' yea, he knoweth them,
and will tenderly regard these, I surely believe,
who are endeavoring to follow Him in the obedience of faith,
not leaning to their own understanding.
What better can we do, dear friend, than to commit the cause unto the Lord,
whose power is above every other power,
hoping and trusting that in his own time He will take it into His own hands,
and then who shall let it.

Thy information of dear Elizabeth`'s improved health was very agreeable,
as also to find you had a prospect of visiting us,
which I hope you may be able to do ere very long.
In the feeling of very tender love to you both,
which I trust is of that kind which waxeth not old,

[.signed-section-closing]
I remain your sincere friend,

"`10th month 12th, 1858.
My beloved brother-in-law, Abraham Gibbons,
departed this life in the 68th year of his age.
He will be much missed in his bereaved family, by his friends,
and also in our poor scattered Society; for the welfare of which he was much concerned,
and continued to be so.
Not many days before the close he said, it is a great mercy to be quietly passing away.

"`12th month 5th. My mind for some time past has
been exercised on account of a poor colored man,
confined in prison at West Chester; who, from reports,
has long been walking in the broad way.
It seemed to me as though it might be right for me to see him;
though many discouragements, such as bodily infirmities,
and a fear lest the blessed Truth might suffer by me, stood as a lion in the way.
But feeling as though my peace of mind was concerned in it, I was enabled to be resigned;
and accordingly went the 29th of last month,
accompanied by cousin James Emlen and my daughter J. The poor erring
man sat solidly while that which arose was communicated to him:
and I was thankful in believing that the mercy and goodness of our compassionate Father,
was still extended to him.
And Oh how did my heart crave that he would yield to the purifying,
cleansing operation of the Holy Spirit, before it is too late;
remembering the solemn declaration of the dear Saviour,
'`How often would I have gathered thee,
but thou wouldst not.`' My mind was afterward favored with a precious feeling:
wherein a desire arose that all the erring,
straying sheep from our Heavenly Father`'s house, might through His adorable mercy,
be brought back to it, where there is bread enough and to spare.`"

[.offset]
+++[+++After the simple statement that they had religious communications at their meeting,
Hannah Gibbons, thus proceeds:]

"`My hearing is so gone that I scarcely knew what was said.
It was a dull, low time with me,
being renewedly made sensible of my nothingness and unworthiness;
and that truly the solemnizing presence of the High and Holy One is not at our command.
Yet He is at times pleased in mercy to favor with it, when words are not spoken.
Gracious Father! be pleased to keep me in a dependent state.

+++[+++The above allusion to silent meetings by our dear friend,
reminds of an expression of one of her contemporaries, likewise passed away,
and also a minister of Christ,
to the effect that she had never been ashamed of a silent meeting;
while she had not unfrequently been ashamed of those not so.
To meetings, either with or without words, the precept applies,
"`There is no power but of God.`"
Friends do not decide beforehand to hold them either in silence or not in silence.
It is only as the eternal Word, the source and centre of all life,
is sought unto and obeyed, that good can be done,
or the souls of those gathered can be edified.
Perhaps there is not an individual member of our religious Society,
who has attained to depth and experience in the mystery of godliness, that has not,
after the injunction,
"`Commune with thine own heart and be still,`" felt
the preciousness and excellence of silent meetings,
and their especial adaptation to our need, and to the true spiritual worship,
which (John 4:23-24) _must_ ever be in spirit and in truth.
The worship of our Father who is in heaven is an exercise of the _soul._
He who looketh on the heart, and hath respect to the intents of it,
will not be satisfied with a substitution,
or anything short of the only acceptable sacrifice
of a broken heart and a contrite spirit.

The following letter is thus endorsed by Hannah Gibbons:]

"`The within is the latter part of a letter sent to William and Elizabeth Evans,
dated 4th month 4th, 1859.`"

[.embedded-content-document.letter]
--

Yearly Meeting is fast approaching,
and I doubt not brings an increase of exercise to thy mind, and also to dear Elizabeth,
in which you have my tender sympathy.
But how consoling is it that you can say from heartfelt experience,
Hitherto the Lord hath helped us;
and I trust He will help you even unto the end of the tribulated path.
The encouraging language unsought for, sweetly arises in my mind as applicable to you:
'`Fear thou not; for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God:
I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea,
I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.`'
How excellent are the promises of the High and Holy One;
and not any of them fail to those who put their trust in Him alone.
I sometimes, when in my better way,
feel a desire once more to sit with my friends in Yearly Meeting; and,
according to my small ability,
endeavor to bear a portion of suffering with my brethren and sisters,
which I have no doubt will be experienced there: but my infirmities,
which seem to increase, soon remind me that home is the most suitable place for me,
except some smaller exertion of getting to our own meeting;
which I have mostly been favored to do;
and though they are often sat through in poverty of spirit,
yet at other times I feel comforted and refreshed,
I trust I may say with a little of that bread which comforteth the soul,
and strengthens the poor weary traveller to take fresh courage, to trust, and hope,
and struggle on, not doubting that He who careth for the sparrows,
will continue to care for his humble, depending children.
I sometimes marvel, considering the state of our Society,
that our meetings on First-days are so largely attended:
and I think we are at times favored in silence to feel a solemnity, not at our command,
spread over us; upon which the language has arisen: '`Lord,
what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou visitest him.`'

Your late visit we have in pleasant remembrance;
and if we were so situated that we could frequently step in and commune with each other,
it would indeed be grateful to me.
'`they who feared the Lord spake often one to another,`' etc.
There is often strength and comfort derived from it to those who see eye to eye,
and who are endeavoring to walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing.
We miss dear brother A.`'s company very much, not only at meeting,
but in our little family.
Yet we mourn not as those who have no hope.
Though the dear sufferer said but little during his illness,
yet it seemed to me each time I sat by him,
that his mind was centered in quiet confiding trust;
and we have the consoling hope that his end was crowned with peace.

Thy letter of Twelfth month last was acceptable and instructive to me,
as all thine have been:
only I fear thou hast too high an opinion of my religious experience;
for truly I often feel myself to be a poor worm,
not worthy of the least of all His favors.
Often do I desire, and hope I may say with increasing fervency,
that I may be preserved from bringing dishonor on the blessed Truth,
which I think I feel at seasons to be exceedingly precious.
And now in conclusion, I may express the desire which I feel in sincerity, that when you,
dear friends, are favored to approach the mercy seat,
that myself and dear daughter may be remembered;
and preservation asked for us in the strait and narrow way,
watching unto prayer even unto the end.

The foregoing has been written at several times, and is scarcely worth sending,
only as an assurance that you are held in tender affection; and,
according to the ability afforded, in gospel fellowship, by your unworthy, aged friend,

"`5th month, 1859.
I was favored to attend our Quarterly Meeting at Concord, though in much feebleness.
In the Select Meeting, my mind was impressed with the need we have of more inwardness,
more weightiness of spirit, and more self-abasement.
In the Meeting for Discipline next day,
I was concerned to endeavor to impress the minds of the
beloved youth with the beauty there is in holiness,
and the excellence there is in a possession in the unchangeable Truth.
Fervent were my desires, that they might early embrace the offers of heavenly love,
and thereby become as a city set on an hill which cannot be hid:
that others seeing their good works may glorify our Father who is in Heaven.

"`6th month 19th. Having been absent several meeting days on account of indisposition,
I was enabled to get there today;
being likewise impressed with the importance of attending
in a suitable disposition of mind.
Not long after taking my seat the language arose,
Who are they that are fit for the Lord`'s work and service?
Surely they only who feel their own unfitness.
Man in his finite wisdom cannot find out God: spiritual things are only spiritually known.
Though the labor seemed in much weakness,
yet am favored this afternoon with a portion of peaceful quiet;
for which I desire to be thankful.

"`3rd month 5th. For some time past I have felt much poverty of spirit,
and often deep discouragement and mourning on account
of our poor Society in its unsettled situation.
And my mind being frequently impressed with desires
for the preservation and welfare of the beloved youth,
and this recently with increasing weight,
attended with a prospect of having a meeting appointed principally for that class,
I could not feel easy to omit mentioning the subject
to some Friends of experience and weight;
and accordingly did so at the close of our meeting last Fourth-day,
though in the feeling of great weakness and inability.
They uniting with the prospect, a meeting was held in our meetinghouse, W. C.,
yesterday afternoon, which was pretty largely attended: and I thought a good meeting,
wherein I was enabled to relieve my mind of an exercise
which at times had long attended it.
Our valued friend P. R. was also engaged in testimony.
And now, after all the discouragements my poor mind has passed through,
to feel peaceful and quiet, I trust I may say an holy quiet,
is cause for reverent thankfulness to Him, who, when He putteth forth,
condescends to go before those who desire faithfully to serve Him.

"`12th month 9th. Though weak in body I went to see our afflicted friend and
neighbor A. E. I thought there was a feeling of solemnity spread over us;
and by endeavoring to keep near to Divine counsel in expressing what arose,
both in testimony and on bended knee, I was favored to return somewhat refreshed,
even as a brook by the way to the weary traveller.

"`11th. I was enabled to get to meeting,
where it seemed to me we had a solemn time in silence;
reviving the hope that we are not a forsaken people.
May seasons of this kind be had in grateful remembrance,
seeing they are no more at our command than the showers
which fall from the clouds on the thirsty ground.

"`12th. Owing to the state of things, not only in our poor unsettled Society,
but in the world at large;
there being much excitement in the minds of many on the subject of slavery,
my mind has been humbled and exercised at seasons;
and the secret breathing of it hath been, Lord preserve me from evil;
being desirous of studying to be quiet, and doing my own business,
and of committing the cause, which is, according to my ability for feeling, I trust,
near my heart, unto Him,
who can turn the heart as a man turneth the watercourse in his field.

"`27th. I think I can adopt the language, '`Verily there is a reward for the righteous,
verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.`' Be pleased, O holy Father,
to make me more pure!
And, if consistent with Thy blessed will,
anoint my spiritual eye with the eye salve of thy kingdom,
so that I may see more clearly the things which belong
to Thine honor and my soul`'s peace:
and wilt thou enable me to do them?
And now in my feeble and tottering state of body,
be pleased to keep my mind more free from the mixture of self, and near unto Thee:
and enable me, a poor worm of the dust, to continue to have my confidence fixed in Thee,
the Rock of ages, against which the gates of hell shall not be able to prevail.`"

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++How sweetly is the humbled, chastened christian character, even that of a little child,
manifested in the foregoing memorandum.
How self-distrustful was she;
and with what feelings of unworthiness as "`a poor worm of the
dust,`" does she look towards the termination of all things here.
Yet how earnest were her breathings to the Lord of life and glory to have the eye re-anointed,
and, as the one thing needful, to be kept near to Him, the only Physician of value,
and Saviour of sinners, and Rock of ages,
against which no divination or enchantment shall be able to prevail.

Strongly in contrast is this with a profession of religion
built upon the assumption that we are regenerated,
justified,
and saved by the propitiatory sacrifice and imputed righteousness of Christ without us,
while we may have never witnessed Him within, in His second coming,
and spiritual manifestation of light, and life, and power, to illuminate the soul,
and to cleanse it from all sin.
The apostle declares, "`By the one offering,
he (the dear Saviour) hath perfected forever them that are sanctified.`"
It is this state of perfection or holiness,
experienced through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost,
with the new heart and the new spirit consequent upon it,
that our Father in heaven hath promised to all those who shall abide His saving baptism,
and coming as "`a refiner`'s fire and like fuller`'s soap.`"
These also He will try in the furnace of adversity as gold is tried in the fire;
will bring through many tribulations; will wash, sanctify,
and justify in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God;
and finally present faultless before the throne of His glory with exceeding joy.

The new feature of doctrine alluded to, at least new among us,
finds no encouragement from the memoranda and example of Hannah Gibbons:
whose whole life was one of self-distrust, of self-denial, humility,
and watchful restraint.
We remember also, in this connection, an expression of the wise and good John Woolman,
when near the close of his remarkable life: "`My dependence is in the Lord Jesus, who,
I trust, will forgive my sins, which is all I hope for.`"
Daniel Wheeler`'s testimony, when also on the bed of death, is of like significance, viz:
"`During the operation of bleeding, D. Wheeler remarked to his medical attendant,
'`without blood there is no cleansing.`' Doctor W. replied,
'`it is the blood of Jesus that cleanseth us from
all our sins.`' '`Yes,`' said his patient,
'`but not in our natural, unregenerate state: when we are in the light,
as He is in the light, then I believe it will cleanse us from all our sins.
Yes,`' he added with much emphasis, '`I know it.`'`"

Christ Jesus is the unchangeable Way to the kingdom of heaven:
and the breaking down of our own will, through the obedience of faith,
and the submission of our hearts unto Him,
must ever remain the self-denying and ever narrow path which all His must walk in.
May we not only choose,
but like best that path which is well beaten by the footsteps of the flock,
though it be not one of smoothness and ease;
neither always pleasant and without mortifications and tribulations.
There are many easy roads that seem plausible,
and streams smooth and wide in which the "`galley with oars`" may go,
and the "`gallant ship can pass;
but it is the part of wisdom carefully and prayerfully
to enquire if they be safe ways--leading to peace.]

"`1st month 27th, 1860.
Feeling poorly in body, which is often my experience,
yet not quite easy to omit going to meeting,
I went with the assistance of my dear daughter, being very poor in spirit.
I had not sat long before my mind was engaged for our spiritual welfare;
that we might trust in the Lord, with all our hearts,
and not lean to our own understanding;
and that some present might be prevailed upon to cease from their own selfish reasoning,
because man in his finite wisdom, cannot find out God;
that spiritual things were only to be spiritually known.
The exercise so remained with me as to induce me to express something of it.
It felt to me a time of solemnity, and renewed invitation to some;
and the silent breathing of my spirit in the latter part of the meeting was,
that these might unreservedly yield to the offers of continued mercy,
remembering the solemn declaration of the Redeemer,
'`the night cometh wherein no man can work.`'

"`2nd month 8th. This day I have entered my ninetieth year.
I went to meeting in much feebleness of body, and poverty of spirit,
yet was enabled to breathe in secret for more purity of heart,
with more freedom from the mixture of self:
and that we as a Society might shine with more clearness.

"`25th. My dear grand-daughter, J. G. Rhoads,
departed this life in the twentieth year of her age: a close bereavement to her parents,
and more so to me than I expected.
She was a promising young woman,
but we have the consolation of believing her end was crowned with peace,
and she taken from the evil to come--a great mercy.

"`4th month 15th. Being poorly in body, I did not get to meeting.
I am often led to reflect on the uncertainty of time,
to which the many deaths that have occurred within the circle
of our acquaintance in the course of a few months,
has contributed.
'`Be ye also ready, for at such an hour as ye think not,
the Son of man cometh.`' A week ago I went to meeting
impressed with considerations similar to the foregoing.
I had not sat long before my mind became weightily engaged in desire that we might be
earnestly concerned to the making preparation for a never-ending and blessed eternity;
with the impression there were those present who were favored
with a renewed visitation from the high and holy One,
and who were under his chastening hand.
It seemed best for me to endeavor to express something of my exercise in testimony:
after which supplication was offered to the Father of mercies,
that He might be pleased to be with us, and not forsake us,
and for those who were under His preparing hand,
that they might keep their eye single unto Him all the appointed season.
In the afternoon I was favored with a comfortable quiet.
Indeed,
if we are enabled to get along through our religious
exercises without experiencing condemnation,
it is of the Lord`'s mercy; especially such poor creatures as myself.`"

[.salutation]
Esteemed young friend.

It may be altogether unexpected to thee to receive a letter from me,
being unacquainted with thee, yet I may say my mind has for a considerable time past,
been frequently turned towards thee in desire for thy best welfare.
When we seriously reflect on our very dependent state, that in Him who created us,
we live, and move, and have our being,
and that without His holy assistance we cannot even think one good thought,
how very needful it is that we should seek Him morning by morning,
and more often than the morning,
that He may be pleased to guide our steps aright through this changing scene.
Uncertainty is marked on all these lower enjoyments,
and how liable they are to waste and decay!
I feel a very tender solicitude for thee, my friend,
that while thou art desirous of obtaining worldly knowledge,
and perhaps I may say distinction amongst men,
thou mayst not be regardless of that which is of so much more importance,
that of laying up heavenly treasure,
by attending to the monitions of Divine grace in the secret of thy own mind;
remembering that the visitations of our Heavenly Father`'s love are not at our command;
and ought to be cherished and obeyed, yea, regarded with reverence and holy fear.

I now remember a circumstance which I heard related many years ago,
of a person who had been favored with the visitations
of heavenly love from time to time in early life,
who endeavored to satisfy his mind with the resolution
that after he had accomplished such and such objects,
he would then give up to be more religious.
But when that time arrived, those tendering impressions with which he had been favored,
were not at his command, yet he realized it to be no easier to yield to them,
and still put off the great work to a more convenient season.
Truly they are not at our command.
It is therefore of great importance to us that we accept
the offers of Divine mercy while they are graciously afforded,
lest we should be left to ourselves,
and in the close of life have to utter the lamentable language, '`the harvest is past,
the summer is ended, and I am not saved.`' I hope better things for thee, my friend,
yea I may say, my beloved young friend,
feeling I trust a measure of that love that would,
if obedience kept pace with heavenly wisdom, gather all into its own blessed enclosure.
May this be more and more thy experience,
and may thy faith be strengthened in the all-sufficiency
of His power whom the winds and waves obey.
For, '`Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.`'

I trust thou wilt excuse the freedom I have taken in thus addressing thee,
as nothing short of a desire for thy preservation, and the relief of my own mind,
would have induced me to do it.
Knowing also the feelings of a parent, I think I may safely say,
on behalf of thy dear parents,
that they would have no greater joy than to see their children walk in the Truth;
and I believe it is well pleasing in the sight of our Heavenly Father,
that children should tenderly regard the counsel of pious parents.
I write as things revive in my mind, and now remember that we read in Holy Scripture,
the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord.
May thine, dear young friend, through obedience to His holy law written in the heart,
be so ordered by Him that thou may be favored with the peace which passeth all understanding,
is the fervent solicitude of thy sincere friend,

"`7th month 1st. In our meeting I was solemnly impressed
with the language of the Most High to a people formerly:
'`Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee,`' etc.
Thus my mind was clothed with desires for those who
I feared might be in a lukewarm or rebellious state,
that such might be aroused to diligence in the Christian
warfare while time was mercifully afforded,
lest the awful language should be uttered,
'`let him that is filthy be filthy still.`' It was a time of close exercise:
yet as I endeavored to express that which I thought was required, I was favored with,
I trust, an holy quiet.

"`9th month 8th. After having been absent more than five weeks from meeting,
through indisposition, I was favored to sit again with Friends.
My mind was more than usually impressed with a sense of the greatness,
goodness and mercy of our Heavenly Shepherd,
attended with desires that all might be gathered into the fold of His flock and family;
and that I myself might never distrust His goodness, but be kept steadfast unto the end,
which I frequently think cannot be far distant.
Oh, Lord! be pleased to prepare me for the solemn event.

"`30th. The present is a day of close trial and searching of heart
to those who are concerned for the welfare of our religious Society.
Nevertheless, a hope at times arises,
that as those who are concerned to maintain it on its ancient foundation, keep,
through holy help, steadfast, there will in the Lord`'s time be a gathering unto them,
and our poor Society be favored with increasing settlement,
and know an arising as in ancient beauty.`"

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++The conditions upon which the cheering hopes, contained in this record, are based,
should lead each one of us to the diligent heed and inquiry:
Are we concerned faithfully to maintain the doctrines
and testimonies of this religious Society,
as transmitted to us by the early Friends, on "`its ancient foundation?`"
That so, agreeably to the testimony of Hannah Gibbons,
an "`increasing settlement`" and "`an arising as in ancient beauty`" shall he witnessed.
May the Father of mercies hasten this good day.
But will there not have to be a searching of the camp first; it may be family by family,
and man by man,
that "`the accursed thing,`"--the idol of the heart,--in whatever consisting,
and wherever found, be brought to the light?
That so purged, as in the valley of Achor, which meaneth trouble,
the Lord shall once more pity and forgive, and enable us to stand before our enemies;
that the shout of a king be again heard to the praise
and glory of the unchangeable God of Israel;
and the banner of holiness be unfurled with the invitation, "`O, house of Jacob,
come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord.`"
Let us see to it that the testimonies entrusted to us to bear before the world,
be not impugned or "`taken from us through slackness or unfaithfulness,
and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.`"]

[.small-break]
'''

"`9th month 30th, 1860.
On going to meeting,
my mind was humbled therein under a sense of the need we have of Holy Help.
Feeling constrained to bow the knee in solemn supplication to the Father of mercies,
I besought Him that He would be pleased to be with us, and not forsake us.
The feeble-minded were brought into view, and the beloved youth also,
that they might be willing to bow their necks to His yoke,
not leaning to their own understanding:
that so a succession of testimony bearers might be raised
for His ever-excellent cause of truth and righteousness.
After taking my seat, the language of David soon impressed me, '`Why art thou cast down,
O my soul?
and why art thou disquieted within me?
Hope thou in God;
for I shall yet praise Him for the help of his countenance.`'
Encouragement flowed freely to drooping minds,
to trust in the Lord Jehovah, in whom there is everlasting strength.
Upon returning home, I was favored with peaceful quiet, having nothing to regret:
an unmerited favor.

"`11th month 11th. Returned from our meeting,
wherein I was favored to feel secret desires for my own preservation,
and those who were assembled with me;
being renewedly made sensible that we cannot preserve ourselves,
as '`It is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.`' The excellence
also of retiring often to wait upon the Lord for the renewal of
our strength was impressively brought before me,
attended with desires that not only the beloved youth,
but we who are more advanced in life, might be frequently in the practice of it:
that so the things which perish with the using, might have less place in our minds,
and those things which belong to our peace and accompany our salvation,
might be more earnestly sought after, even by the whole human family.

"`12th month 15th. My beloved relative Jesse J. Maris,
departed this life in the 68th year of his age;
a valuable elder and member of Chester Monthly Meeting.
He will not only be a great loss to his bereaved family,
and in the meeting to which he belonged, but in our religious Society at large.

"`1st month 10th, 1861.
Our valued and much beloved friend Hannah P. Davis, was taken from us by death.
She was a very useful member and elder of Birmingham Monthly Meeting;
and the influence of her meek and quiet spirit was precious.
In our meeting my mind being solemnly impressed with the loss we had sustained
by the removal of those who were as the salt of the earth,
supplication was raised to the Father of Mercies, that He would be pleased,
through the baptisms of His own Holy Spirit,
to raise up and qualify a succession of testimony bearers
for His ever blessed cause of truth and righteousness:
whereby His name might be glorified, and His church edified.`"

West Chester, 1st month 1861.

[.salutation]
My dear friend Asenath Clarke,

Our mutual friend A. R., kindly gave me the privilege of reading thy letter to her,
received some weeks since.
It was comforting to me to be so affectionately remembered by thee,
bringing as it did to my remembrance our first acquaintance; when we were, I do believe,
according to my little ability, drawn together in gospel fellowship.
This has been renewed from time to time,
so that I can feelingly adopt thy own expression,
'`thou hast been as an epistle written in my heart.`' I
have often thought I should be rejoiced to hear from thee,
and now to find that thou art renewedly engaged in the good Master`'s service,
is encouraging.
Truly we do not serve an hard Master;
for though He may see meet in His wisdom to dispense close baptisms,
and we may have to feel much poverty of spirit, and many low seasons,
for the trial of our faith and patience,
yet in His own time how does He condescend to afford a portion
of that bread which nourisheth and strengthens the poor weary traveller
to journey forward in the tribulated path.

The days we live in are days of trial.
For the divisions amongst us there are great searchings of heart.
May the unsettled situation of our religious Society, be a means of humbling our hearts,
and bringing us nearer unto Him who '`seeth not as
man seeth.`' May we '`study to be quiet,
and to mind our own business;`' each one seeking for Holy Help
to '`build over against his own house.`' If we were truly humbled
and brought into a sense of our own nothingness and dependence,
I trust the great I Am, would, in His goodness and mercy,
compassionate our low condition and help us; for vain is the help of man.
I sometimes feel a comfortable hope that as those in the different places who
are concerned to maintain our once favored Society on its ancient foundation,
are favored to keep their standing in the Truth,
that in due time there will be a gathering unto them;
and an arising experienced out of our present difficulties:
so that our poor Society may yet shine in ancient beauty,
even as a '`city set on a hill which cannot be hid;`' when others seeing our good works,
may be brought to glorify our Father who is in heaven.

We have both, dear friend, experienced an important change and afflictive dispensation,
since we saw each other,
in the decease of our beloved husbands--our outward stay and staff to lean upon.
It has been a close bereavement indeed; yet I believe we may say,
Hitherto the Lord hath helped us; and I trust He will help, even unto the end,
as the eye of our minds are kept single unto Him.

I think thou mentioned in thy letter to A. R.,
the names of Hannah Rhoads and Mary Passmore.
They are both friends we love;
and I may just mention that at the funeral of Jesse J. Maris,
which my daughter recently attended,
dear Hannah was impressively drawn forth in the exercise of her gift,
to a large assembly, while standing at the grave, though it was a wet time.
I think it may be safely said she is a humble follower of our blessed Saviour.
And, my precious friend, may He who has renewedly called thee into His vineyard to labor,
condescend to be with thee in every season of conflict and trial,
support and strengthen thee for His work and service, and when it is accomplished,
reward with the sheaves of peace.

In very tender love and sympathy, and, according to my small measure, gospel fellowship,
I remain thy friend,

"`1st month 16th, 1861.
My beloved cousin, Joseph Rhoads, departed this life after a short illness.
He was a valuable and useful member of our religious Society,
and an elder of Chester Monthly Meeting.
I think it may be said, he was remarkable for his circumspect walk through life.

"`1st month 23rd. Rebecca Jackson was taken from among us by death,
after a lingering illness.
My mind was often in sympathy with the dear young woman while living,
and I would have gladly visited her and her widowed mother,
but from bodily indisposition consequent upon advanced age, I was prevented:
yet my tender sympathy still flows towards the dear bereaved mother.
Truly by the removal of so many and varied in age, the language is forcibly sounded,
'`Be ye also ready,`' etc.

"`3rd month 22nd. Died our much loved and valued friend Mary Kite, a minister,
in the 69th year of her age.
The weight of her spirit will be much missed in our Monthly Meeting;
while her consistent life and conversation held forth the language to survivors,
Follow me as I am endeavoring to follow Christ.
She was indeed an example worthy to be followed,
and through faithful attention to her religious services,
in much infirmity of body at times,
was permitted to look at the termination of her earthly pilgrimage with holy hope.

"`4th month 29th. I omitted to mention in its proper place,
that about three months since I had a spell of sickness; during which season,
an exercise I had felt for a considerable time so pressed upon my mind,
that I thought the time had come to endeavor to make some move in it:
which was to have a religious opportunity in a family near us,
who are descendants of Friends, but not members of our religious Society.
Mentioning the subject to a Friend in the station of elder, he did not discourage me;
and way being made for it, a visit was performed a few weeks since,
much to the relief of my mind, and apparently acceptably to the family for whose welfare,
both parents and children, I had felt tenderly interested.
Although I went to see them under much discouragement, and trust I may say holy fear,
yet to be enabled to relieve my mind, and feel the reward of peace,
is a favor which I desire to have in grateful remembrance
to the Author of all our sure mercies,
now in this advanced age, being in my 91st year.

"`5th month 5th. It is a time of sorrow and of lamentation
from the scourge of war threatening our country.
Several companies of soldiers are now in this place,
waiting I suppose the word of command to engage in hostile measures.
Being favored to get to our meeting today, it felt to me that in the early part of it,
there was a solemnity spread over us.
I do not doubt but that many hearts present were turned to the Lord in
earnest solicitude for their own preservation and that of others.
The solemnity of the occasion was cause for thankfulness to the Author of all good.
Several soldiers were present.

"`6th month 10th. For two weeks or more I have felt poorly in body,
so as to be mostly confined to my chamber.
It has been a time of looking over my past life,
wherein some omissions came plainly before me, to my humiliation.
Secret desires were raised to the Father of all our sure mercies,
for more purity of heart;
and that I might be more entirely dedicated to His blessed will,
the few remaining days of my lengthened pilgrimage.
Being favored to get to meeting yesterday,
my mind was early brought under exercise for our
individual advancement in the blessed Truth;
more especially the younger part of those assembled.
It felt to me that it would be best to express something of my exercise,
which I was enabled to do to the relief of my mind.

"`10th month 8th. For some time past it has been
with me a season of trial and close proving,
wherein desires have been raised, that all which opposes the Lord`'s will in me,
might be reduced and laid in the dust.
Upon going to meeting day before yesterday,
my mind became awfully impressed with the spirit of supplication, which being yielded to,
I was afterwards favored with a degree of peaceful quiet,
though not so much relieved as at some other times.
The silent breathing of my spirit is this morning,
Father of Mercies! be pleased to keep me near unto thyself in this time of conflict,
enabling me to bear patiently the turning of Thy Holy Hand upon me,
and suffer nothing to be done by me, but that which will be to Thine honor,
and my soul`'s peace.
Amen.
Not long after the foregoing was penned, my mind was favored with such quiet,
that indeed it seemed as though the enemy was chained down by Divine power;
and I was permitted to partake of a little of that bread,
which nourisheth and strengthens the weary traveller to journey forward.

"`11th month.
My dear friend Elizabeth Evans,
suddenly departed this life about the middle of this month.
She was a dignified servant of the Lord.
May He be pleased to raise up, and qualify a succession of laborers in his harvest;
that so His blessed cause of Truth and righteousness may never want advocates,
is the present breathing of my spirit.`"

+++[+++After an allusion to an attack of extreme illness,
which commenced on the 31st of First month, 1862, and continued for more than two months,
Hannah Gibbons thus writes 6th month 5th:
"`I experienced many low seasons and trials of faith and patience;
being scarcely able to ask for an increase.
But at some other seasons a hope was mercifully granted,
that I was not forgotten by Him who careth for the sparrows:
yet my mind was permitted to be distressed at times with doubts
and fears respecting my acceptance with the High and Holy One;
being renewedly and solemnly impressed with our dependent state,
and of our liability to err, as well as that of ourselves, without Divine aid,
we can do nothing.
Desires were also felt, that self might be so reduced,
that nothing might remain in me which would oppose the Lord`'s will.
After a close searching exercise, I became favored with a comfortable calm,
which no human aid could give: and the language arose,
'`the Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him,
in those that hope in his mercy.`' My hope in His mercy was renewed;
and I could say in the secret of my heart,
'`the Lord is a stronghold in the day of trouble.`' May
the foregoing season ever be held in grateful remembrance.
It is unexpected and not desirable to me to be even
thus far restored to health and strength;
yet I crave to be preserved in patience, until He who giveth life is pleased to take it.
And that I may be kept from bringing dishonor on
His blessed Truth the few remaining days of my pilgrimage,
is often the silent prayer of my heart.
I am now in my 92nd year.]

[.small-break]
'''

"`7th month 13th. I was favored again to sit with Friends in our meeting,
which felt a privilege of no small value.
I was renewedly impressed with desires for myself and those assembled,
that more purity of heart might be experienced;
and that we might be preserved from any mixture of self in our religious duties.
Love flowed to my brethren and sisters in silence,
and I felt a degree of thankfulness that I had been
permitted to sit with them once more.`"

[.signed-section-context-open]
7th month, 1862.

[.salutation]
My dear nephews +++_______+++ and +++_______+++,

My mind is often turned towards you in tender affection
and heartfelt desire for your best welfare;
and not knowing that I shall have an opportunity of expressing it verbally,
feel inclined to convey something of it in this way.
It is good for us to remember that here we have no continuing city,
and to seek one which hath foundations whose builder and maker is the Lord,
ought to be our first and greatest concern.
I am aware that it is needful for us to be careful
to provide for the comfort of these poor bodies,
yet how much more important it is,
that we should be concerned for the immortal part--that which lives beyond the grave.
We may suffer our minds to be so engrossed in worldly pursuits,
which are fading and transitory, as to hinder our progress in the heavenly journey.
It is well for us to bear in mind,
that enjoyments which belong to this life will fail
to satisfy the longings of an immortal soul,
if we have time given for reflection at that solemn
season which will sooner or later overtake us all.
We see from time to time, those who are cut off as in a moment;
and none of us know how soon we may be called upon to give
an account of our stewardship to a just and righteous judge.
Hence the necessity of our living each day as though it was our last;
not looking outward, but endeavoring to know the Lord for ourselves,
agreeably to what is written,
'`that which is to be known of God is manifest within,`' etc.
I feel while I write love to flow towards you, the children of a beloved sister;
whose anxious desire for the welfare of her dear offspring I was a witness to,
and therefore write the more freely.
We read in Holy Scripture that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

May you more and more be concerned to live in His fear, even the fear of offending Him.
Those who do so are comforted at seasons with His favor,
and the shedding abroad of His love in their hearts,
which is more to be desired than any worldly acquisition,
and surpasseth the understanding of man, and the power of argument.
We are very dependent beings on Him who created us.
In Him we live and move and have our being; and from whom we receive every blessing,
both spiritual and temporal.
Even our daily food and raiment demand our humble gratitude,
and yet how liable we are to forget our dependent state,
and the many blessings we are favored with.
I do not forget while I write that it is but little we can do one for another,
beyond the effort to stir up the pure mind by way of remembrance of our religious duty.
Though '`Paul may plant and Apollos water,`' it is God who giveth the increase.
Therefore unto Him may you look for help and strength in the heavenward path,
which it is my great desire you should be found in.
We may make a fair show amongst men, yea,
our lives may be conformed to a standard of moral rectitude,
yet if we do not come to experience a union and communion with the Spirit of Truth,
and an obeying its secret monitions,
we shall not experience an advancement in the high and holy way
cast up for the ransomed and redeemed of the Lord to walk in.
That may you, my dear nephews,
by increasing dedication of your own wills to the Lord`'s will,
be found to know an increase in vital religion,
is the feeling desire of one who loves you.
Hoping you will excuse the freedom I have taken in thus writing,
having nothing in view by it but your best welfare and the relief of my own mind,
and with love to, desiring you may be one another`'s helper in the Lord,
I am your affectionate, and truly well-wishing aunt,

"`7th month 1862.
I was favored to sit with Friends again in our meeting to my comfort;
and the following Seventh day met with Friends in our select preparative meeting,
a small number.
Here my mind was impressed with the belief,
that the more unreservedly we endeavored to serve the Lord,
the more we should experience Him to be a stronghold in the day of trouble.

"`27th. I was favored to get to meeting, though in much feebleness of body.
Poverty of spirit was my portion.

"`My mind frequently, in the time of my late sickness,
was impressed with desires for the welfare of my neighbors and those round about,
whom I feared were too much in the practice of collecting and sitting about the streets,
especially public houses, on First-day afternoon,
when probably their conversation was not of an improving kind.
It arose with me, I thought with a degree of freshness,
and in the remembrance of our dependent state,
to have some tracts of a religious nature spread among them.
On mentioning the subject to my worthy cousin, James Emlen,
he expressed a willingness to select the tracts, and hand them where he thought suitable;
which has been relieving to me.
Having about the same time, from feelings tenderly interested in their welfare,
written a letter to my nephews +++_______+++ and +++_______+++,
both these little acts of dedication afford a peaceful retrospect.

"`8th month 5th. For several months past some omissions of duty,
which I thought had been passed over by the Searcher of hearts,
have freshly revived with me, attended with painful feelings, doubts, and fears,
respecting my state of acceptance with the Most High.
But on waking early this morning,
my mind became unexpectedly clothed with a comfortable feeling,
and encouragement was felt from promises that seemed sealed upon my spirit,
viz:--'`I have graven thee on the palms of my hands,`' etc.
'`thy name is written in the Lamb`'s book of life;`' attended
with a sweetness of feeling which no human aid could give.
I write with fears and care lest I should say more than the Truth would allow;
but may add my heart was raised in thankfulness, as on the banks of deliverance,
to Him who alone is able to help us on our heavenward journey.
Gracious Father! may neither heights nor depths, things present nor to come,
be suffered to separate me from thy love in Christ Jesus our Lord;
who for the joy that was set before Him, endured the cross, despising the shame,
and is now set down at the right hand of Thy majesty on high;
there making intercession for poor erring man.
The foregoing season of favor I desire to have in grateful
remembrance to the Author of all our sure mercies.`"

+++[+++After alluding to a season of indisposition, wherein she says,]
"`My feeble strength was reduced,
and my mind a part of the time closely tried,`" +++[+++Hannah
Gibbons writes under date of 8th month 27th.]
"`I was favored to get to Monthly Meeting in much feebleness of body.
I had not sat long before my mind was clothed with the spirit of supplication,
not only for myself, but also those assembled with me,
that we might be preserved in this day of close proving;
that our hearts might be so humbled,
that we might be favored to know the voice of our
heavenly Shepherd from that of the stranger;
and so furnished with Holy Help as to obey all His requirings;
that the faith of the youth might be strengthened, and they be enabled to say,
'`the things I know not,
teach thou me.`' The foregoing impressions felt renewedly solemn;
but being enabled to yield to what I believed was required,
my mind was afterwards favored with a calm,
comparable to '`lying down beside the still waters.`'

"`31st. Desires were raised for preservation.
It seems to me a day wherein the enemy of our souls is very busy,
and the need of watchfulness and prayer, is impressively felt,
Gracious Father! be pleased to keep me from evil,
and from all the by-ways and crooked paths of the enemy.
Thou alone art able to do it; for '`of ourselves we can do nothing.`'

"`9th month 21st. For some time past I have felt interested in the welfare of two individuals,
not members of our Society, and with whom I am not much acquainted,
+++_______+++ and +++_______+++.
Having heard lately of their being in an afflicted situation,
I was much drawn towards them in sympathy;
so much so that I thought of trying to go to see them,
but was discouraged on account of my feeble state.
On mentioning my exercise to cousin James Emlen, he kindly entered into feeling with me,
and said,
'`perhaps thou could relieve thy mind by writing and I would willingly take it and read
it to them.`' On reflecting on the subject the proposal felt easy to me,
and I was enabled to express my feelings in writing;
which J. Emlen took and read to them.
It appeared acceptable to both, particularly to the mother, who was tender,
took the visit kindly, and sent her love to me.
Her son was unable to speak from the effect of paralysis.
Thus I was relieved from the exercise;
for which I think I may say a degree of humble thankfulness is experienced.

"`25th. Being, with some assistance, favored to get to our week-day meeting,
I think I may say a lively exercise was experienced for myself and those assembled,
that in this day of trial, when war and rumors of war are often heard among us,
we might know a building on the sure Foundation, Jesus Christ the Rock of Ages.
Lord! be pleased to keep the little ones, who have no might of their own,
as in the hollow of Thy Holy Hand.
A comfortable degree of hope in the mercies of the Shepherd of Israel was renewed,
and desires raised that I might be preserved from the destroyer,
who is going about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.

"`10th month 17th. Yesterday we had the company of
my beloved friend William Evans and his daughter,
from Philadelphia, at our Monthly Meeting, and a few hours at our house.
William`'s humble walk and solid deportment were strengthening to my mind.
It seemed to me at meeting,
there was a solemnity spread over us which was comfortable to feel,
and cause for thankfulness to the Author of all our blessings.
Though my deafness for a considerable time past has prevented
my hearing what has been said in our religions meetings,
desires have been raised, that being thus much deprived of this outward sense,
my inward ear might be increasingly attentive to Divine guidance.

"`My dear sister Edith Edge having been with us a few days very acceptably,
has just left us.
I feel lonely and stripped as to the outward,
but am favored with a renewal of hope in the Lord`'s mercies;
and that he continues to regard the poor of the flock.
Gracious Father! be pleased to preserve me from evil, in thought, word, or deed;
and renew my strength in the all-sufficiency of thy power
to heal our backslidings when they are repented of.`"

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++"`Repentance towards God,
and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ,`" is the order in which the Apostle
Paul has placed these great and indispensable christian experiences.
Moreover, it was just before the ascension of our blessed Lord,
that He left the charge to his disciples, "`that (firstly) repentance,
and (secondly) remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,
beginning at Jerusalem.`"
Hannah Gibbons, had no doubt in her measure,
experienced through the saving strength of Him whom,
"`God had exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour for to give repentance
to Israel and forgiveness of sins,`" that godly sorrow which worketh repentance to salvation:
and hence her allusion to "`the all-sufficiency`" of that Almighty
"`power to heal our backslidings when they are repented of.`"
Thus it is; when the poor sinner is brought, through the convicting,
convincing power of the Holy Spirit to have the eyes of his understanding opened,
and to be sensible of his sin,
and is grieved and humbled before the Searcher of hearts on account of it,
then He who commandeth all men everywhere to repent,
and causeth His light to shine out of darkness for their guidance, will,
in His condescending love and mercy, grant repentance to life.
For, saith the Apostle, "`the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.`"
And again, "`godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of.`"
In connection herewith may the stirring reproof of the Spirit to the church of Ephesus,
have due place with us in this day of floating opinions, of strange disputations,
of false and beguiling liberty,
and wherein "`the ancient landmarks which our fathers have set,`" are being so removed:
"`I have somewhat against thee, became thou hast left thy first love.
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen; and repent, and do the first works;
or else I '`will come unto thee quickly,
and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.`"]

[.small-break]
'''

"`10th month 19th. In our meeting today,
my mind became early clothed with desires for our best welfare;
and the language of one formerly weightily presenting,
I felt as though I could not be easy without expressing it: '`turn thou me,
and I shall be turned,
for thou art the Lord my God.`' Love flowed freely to the gathered assembly,
and I was favored to return a little refreshed and under no condemnation.
Gracious Father! feed me with food convenient for me,
and teach me to be content therewith.

"`25th. Attended our Select Preparative--and 26th, our First-day meeting for worship.
Both were seasons of lowness to me;
yet I trust desires were raised in both for a continuance of Holy Help.

"`29th. Our Monthly Meeting was held at West Chester:
in which my mind was renewedly impressed with a sense of our dependent state,
and the need we have of Holy help.
Desires were raised for a renewal of strength from time to time to do the Lord`'s will:
and that our eyes might be anointed with the eye-salve of His kingdom,
that we might be enabled to see with holy certainty,
the things which belong to the Lord`'s honor and our soul`'s peace in the day of trouble,
and be enabled to do them.
My mind being clothed with the spirit of supplication, I trust I may say awfully so,
it was yielded to on the bended knee.
After which our valued friend David Cope, was engaged in testimony.
It seemed to me a solemn covering was spread over us, which no human aid could give.
This is cause for thankfulness to Him, who when He opens none can shut,
and when He shuts none can open.

"`11th month 10th, 1862.
Attended our meeting on First-day,
wherein my mind was early drawn to our younger Friends, particularly the brethren,
in this day of awful calamity:^
footnote:[No doubt in allusion to the war of the rebellion then raging.]
that they might be brought into an humble state of mind,
comparable to the passive clay in the hands of the Heavenly Potter,
and experience a willingness to be fashioned and formed according to His own good pleasure;
and thereby be preserved from the many evils that surround us.
After endeavoring to relieve my mind of the exercise, I was favored, I trust I may say,
with a degree of holy quiet.

"`20th. In our week-day meeting I was rather unusually impressed
with desires for the preservation of the dear children,
several of whom came in near together, I suppose from school.
As the exercise continued,
I thought perhaps the school might be the place to express something of it;
but on further weighing the subject, it seemed as though the present was the best time.
After expressing a few words to the dear children particularly,
my mind was renewedly clothed with desires for myself,
to be enabled to leave the things that are behind,
and press forward in the line of apprehended duty in simplicity and faith.`"

12th month 19th, 1862.

[.salutation]
Dear Brother,

My mind being frequently turned towards thee in tender affection,
particularly of latter time, I feel inclined to put pen to paper and tell thee so,
while time and opportunity are afforded, feeling encompassed with infirmities,
and that my time in this state of mutability will not be likely to be much longer.

I may say the nearer the approach of the end of all things here,
the more awful it appears to me;
and to endeavor with Holy Help to be ready for the solemn event, is daily,
and oftener than the day, impressively before me.
Seeing we have no continuing city here,
my mind is at times drawn forth in solicitude for the welfare of others; and for thee,
dear brother, I have desired that nothing appertaining to this world,
may prevent thee from earnestly endeavoring to know the work of the greatest
importance--that of the soul`'s salvation--going on with the day.
We are by nature prone to evil, being the children of disobedience;
and have need of the regenerating, cleansing influence of the Lord`'s Holy Spirit,
the '`Holy Ghost and fire,`' to cleanse us from the impurities of our nature,
comparable to dross and tin.

We read in Holy Scripture that '`Except a man be born again he cannot see the
kingdom of God.`' This of being born again is not agreeable to the natural part;
but I desire for us that "`We may be willing to bear all the turnings
and overturnings of the Lord`'s hand upon us in order for our refinement;
that so all that is offensive in His sight may be removed,
and we be brought into a childlike, teachable state,
wherein a willingness is experienced to do the will of our Heavenly Father.
Then we shall know Him to be our shield and strength in times of trial.
We have an unwearied enemy, who will, if possible, frustrate every good word and work;
that it is needful for us in the present day to remember the
injunction of our blessed Saviour to His disciples formerly:
'`Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.`' Two spirits are striving within us,
and we have need to be humble and watchful in order that we may
know the voice of the true Shepherd from that of the stranger.
But how encouraging is the language of the Saviour of men,
'`My grace is sufficient for thee:
my strength is made perfect in weakness.`' A measure or
manifestation of Divine grace we are all favored with.
If this be yielded to and obeyed,
it will enable us from season to season '`to put the armies
of the aliens to flight,`' our soul`'s enemies,
and to press onward in the heavenward journey.
That this may be thy and my happy experience, my dear brother,
is the present breathing of my spirit.

"`1st month 8th, 1863.
Today I was favored to get to meeting: a privilege of no small value.
I was impressed with a few words which seemed best for me to express.
After which my dear friend L. K., appeared in solemn supplication.
It felt to me to be a time of renewed favor.

"`11th. I was enabled to attend our meeting again,
wherein my mind was weightily engaged in tender concern
for the welfare and preservation of the youth.
Being strengthened to express something of it, I felt peace.
But in the afternoon of the same day I was much exercised,
without experiencing much relief.
Gracious Father! be pleased to enable me to be faithful to all thy requirings.

"`15th and 18th. I was also favored to get to meeting.
Poverty of spirit was experienced; being renewedly made sensible that of ourselves,
without Divine aid, we can do nothing.
Oh that I may be enabled in my daily walk to show forth more of the meekness of wisdom:
that wisdom which is profitable to direct aright.

"`28th. I was favored to get to our Monthly Meeting.
That for worship was a time of labor without experiencing
much of the presence of Heavenly good.
That for discipline was a time of exercise also.
In the answers to the eight queries from our own Preparative
Meeting (West Chester) deficiencies were apparent;
and it felt to me there was little ability to labor for their removal,
with too little zeal that is profitable to direct aright,
even to the putting shoulder to shoulder in order
for the repairing of the waste places in our Zion.`"

+++[+++This of "`putting shoulder to shoulder in order for the repairing
the waste places in our Zion,`" and a deep religious exercise,
each for the salvation of his and her soul, is, we apprehend, much wanting among us.
Is there not danger either of our looking too much to one another for help,
or of allowing supineness or wordly-mindedness to prevail over us,
rather than in seeking to draw water out of the wells of salvation for ourselves?
This spiritual sustenance can only be obtained by waiting upon the Minister of the Sanctuary,
and feeling individually after Him who alone can effectually help us,
and in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom, grace, knowledge, comfort,
an unbounded store.
Were we more greatly athirst for the living water,
which our holy Redeemer declared to the woman of Samaria should
be in her a well of water springing up unto everlasting life,
it is clear that though as a Society we might have
many causes for trembling and for mourning,
yet how would these seasons be truly those for humble joy and thanksgiving,
and drawing nearer unto Him in whose hand our breath is, and whose are all our ways.]

"`3rd month 1st, 1863.
Being poorly I did not get to meeting today; which has been the case frequently of late.
Spiritual poverty hath been much my portion, and is cause of much secret inquiry.
The language of my mind at seasons is to our merciful
Father,--Be pleased to keep my eye single unto Thee;
that thus I may not go before, neither lag behind thy guidance; and that I may,
through thy goodness and mercy, be prepared for the solemn close of this life: which,
the nearer it approaches, the more solemn it often feels to me,
now in the 93rd year of my age.`"

[.salutation]
My dear +++________+++,

On thinking over the subject we spoke of when thou wast here,
+++[+++a question of business,] I feel best satisfied to express a few words in regard to it.
Thou hast been careful to ask advice of friends, whose judgment thou values no doubt,
which is commendable.
But as it is only individual faithfulness that will entitle
us to the favor of Him who seeth not as man seeth,
I would recommend thy consulting the witness for Truth in thy own mind,
and to follow its guidance, which is the alone path of safety.
I believe it is sometimes in the ordering of Divine wisdom that
we are required to take up the cross to that which is seen in the
light of Truth to have too much place in the mind,
that another might feel at liberty to do.
I write for thy consideration and encouragement,
feeling desirous that thou should not only give up to serve our Heavenly Father in part,
but that thou may be enabled to yield to all His requirings.
When this comes to be so, thou wilt, I surely believe,
feel strength afforded from time to time equal to the day;
and thy peace of mind at seasons far transcend any worldly enjoyment.
That this may be more and more thy happy experience is the present breathing of my spirit.
With desires for thy preservation, with that of my own, feeling the need,
even at this advanced age, of watching unto prayer, I conclude,

"`22nd. This morning my mind was clothed with a degree of solemnity;
under which covering I went to meeting,
where I had not sat long before the state of the Apostle Paul near the close of his life,
was brought to my remembrance, viz: '`I am now ready to be offered,
and the time of my departure is at hand,`' etc.
This so impressed my mind with desires that we might individually
strive to know the day`'s work going on with the day,
that it seemed best for me to endeavor to express something of my exercise,
that we might so improve the time while it is mercifully afforded,
as that none when the solemn summons comes, might have to utter the lamentable language,
'`the harvest is over,
the summer is ended and I am not saved:`' but that through
humble obedience to the will of our Heavenly Father,
we might be prepared to receive the welcome salutation of '`Well done,
good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.`'
In the afternoon my mind was favored with quiet.

"`4th month 19th. I was favored to get to meeting though in much feebleness of body.
It seemed to me a time of labor, watching against intruding thoughts.
I was renewedly made sensible that when we are favored
with a little of the dear Master`'s presence,
it is indeed heavenly treasure in these earthen vessels.
Several of our Friends have gone to attend the Yearly Meeting.

"`23rd, and Fifth of the week, I also got to meeting,
and it felt to me there was early a solemnity spread over the few
who gathered--Friends not having returned from the Yearly Meeting.
After a time of waiting,
the promise to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness was impressed on my mind:
'`Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
for they shall be filled.`' It seemed as though it was best for me to mention it,
for the encouragement of some whose eyes might be ready to fail with looking upwards,
and the tongue to cleave to the roof of the mouth.
Though I felt no condemnation on account of the little offering,
yet it was a time of searching of heart, and that part of the prayer of Jabez,
'`Keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me,`' was impressively remembered.
Gracious Father!
Be pleased to keep me from dishonoring thy precious cause of truth and righteousness,
poor and unworthy as I am.

"`26th. I think I am often made sensible of the need we
have of the baptismal influence of the Lord`'s Holy Spirit,
in order that that which is offensive in His sight may be consumed,
and the strong will of man made to bow as at His footstool.
Upon going to meeting with my mind clothed with desires for preservation,
after a time the query of our Divine Master to Simon Peter,
impressed me with so much weight, that it seemed best for me to endeavor to mention it:
Simon, Simon, lovest thou me?
Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee; and again, lovest thou me more than these?
Yea, Lord, thou knowest all things.
Thou knowest that I love thee.
Upon which the command was, Feed my lambs.
It seemed with me to endeavor to encourage us not only to love the Lord,
but to manifest our love by obedience to his commandments.
After which I was solemnly impressed with the spirit of supplication;
and being enabled to bend the knee in awfulness and fear,
my mind became much relieved of its burden;
and a little strength was experienced to journey forward.
Gracious Father! be pleased, I pray Thee, to keep me as in the hollow of Thy holy hand,
from the by-ways and crooked paths which the enemy
of our soul`'s peace is frequently presenting.

"`Fifth month 7th. Yesterday the remains of our valued friend Charles Downing,
and our cousin Richard Oakford, were laid in the grave; also two of our citizens, viz.,
J+++.+++ T., and C K. It was a day of mourning,
and of doubts and fears respecting my own standing
in the sight of Him who seeth not as man seeth,
but looketh at the heart.
But on waking this morning I was mercifully favored with more comfortable feelings;
and the language seemed impressively and encouragingly spoken,
'`I will be with thee.`' Oh!
Lord, wilt thou be pleased to preserve me from doubting again,
and keep me humble and watchful, and under Thy holy guidance.

"`I was enabled to get to meeting today; which was a confirming season in silence.
May I be favored sufficiently to praise Thy holy Name.

"`24th. On looking over my past life,
I impressively feel that many baptisms and close-proving seasons have been my portion,
wherein faith and patience have been ready to fail; and I have had to say with David,
'`Are his mercies clean gone forever?`' Notwithstanding this, the Lord, in His own time,
hath been pleased to afford a renewal of strength to journey forward in fear and trembling.
I was enabled this day in our meeting, to bend the knee in solemn supplication,
that the great I Am might be pleased to give us to see with undoubted clearness,
the things that belong to His honor and our soul`'s peace;
and furnish with strength to do them.
That we might be enabled from time to time to say,
thanks be to Thee who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
The youth were also supplicated for,
that they might be given to see the beauty there is in holiness,
and the excellence of a possession in the unchangeable truth.
That by yielding obedience to the cross of Christ,
testimony bearers to His excellent name might be continued.
My mind is now favored with peaceful quiet; may I be sufficiently thankful.
Our friend M. A. L., was at meeting and appeared in testimony.

"`27th. I was enabled to get to our Monthly Meeting.
The first part of it was a time of silent exercise,
being impressed with a prospect of getting into the men`'s meeting for discipline.
After an excellent Epistle was read among us from our Yearly Meeting,
the desire to sit a little time with our brethren was so impressed upon me,
that I mentioned it; and the concern being united with, our friends E. S., and S. S.,
accompanied me.
I was favored to express what arose;
being more especially impressed with desire that the minds of those,
whose age subjected them to the draft for war purposes,
might be strengthened to uphold our Society`'s peaceable christian testimonies.
Remembering that the gospel dispensation, under which we live, was ushered in with,
'`glory to God in the highest; peace on earth,
and good will to men.`' After this little sacrifice,
I was renewedly strengthened to trust in the Lord, and hope in His mercy.`"

West Chester, 6th month 1863.

[.salutation]
Dear young relative,

It may be unexpected to thee to receive a letter from me,
but my mind having been unexpectedly drawn towards thee,
the short time thou wast with us a few months ago,
in tender solicitude for thy preservation,
and a like desire having frequently impressed my mind since,
I feel inclined to express something of it to thee.
In doing this, while I wish not to be an intruder, not forgetting that thou hast worthy,
religious parents, qualified to counsel thee aright,
I have nevertheless not felt my mind relieved from the desire that
thou may '`Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth,
while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say,
I have no pleasure in them:`' when thou canst no longer find pleasure in those
outward pursuits which the youthful mind oft-times pursues with earnestness,
notwithstanding they often find in them disappointment and trouble.
In this world, and the things of it, we do often meet with sorrows and disquietudes,
but in obedience to the teachings of the Lord`'s holy Spirit in the secret of the heart,
there is peace.
That thou may so yield to the visitations of heavenly
love which I have no doubt thou hast felt,
as to experience more and more of this peace,
which the world can neither give nor take away from the humble obedient mind,
is what I crave for thee.

I well remember in my youthful days when some small sacrifices seemed required of me,
it was suggested to my mind, that if I gave up to be religious,
the way was so narrow that I should see no more pleasure!
If thoughts of this kind are presented to thy mind,
believe most assuredly they come from him, who is the enemy of our soul`'s happiness,
and who was a liar from the beginning; and who will, if possible,
frustrate every good word and work, yea even every good desire;
and whereby also the poor mind is brought into much secret conflict.
In this situation, if it ever be thine,
it is well for us steadily to endeavor to keep our eye single to our Heavenly Father,
'`who knoweth our frame,
and remembereth that we are dust;`' and who graciously condescends
to be with those who love Him and fear to offend Him.
He alone can enable us to overcome the temptations of the evil one,
and afford that peace which far exceeds any worldly enjoyment.
We live in a day of peculiar trials.
A warlike spirit is so prevailing,
that brother is engaged in hostile feelings against brother,
too much forgetting the injunction of our blessed Saviour, '`Love your enemies,
bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,
and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you;
that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven,`' etc.
Friends, as a religious Society, profess peaceable principles;
and I feel earnest and tender desires, according to my ability,
that our beloved young men, as well as those who are older,
may in this time of excitement and trial, be enabled, through holy help,
to maintain our Christian testimonies against all wars and fightings.
We have great need, both older and younger,
to attend to the injunction of our Saviour to His disciples formerly,
'`Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.`' He also said,
'`Without me ye can do nothing.`' But let us remember, dear, that with His holy help,
we can, if faithful, do all things He is pleased to require of us.
Then may thou be enabled to take up the good resolution that Joshua of old did,
'`As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.`' Remember we are accountable beings,
and where much is given much will be required.
Thou hast had a religious, guarded education:
hast had parents who would have no greater joy than to see their children walk in Truth.
These are favors and opportunities surpassing many, yea, very many others;
and those thus favored are, I believe, more looked to for example,
than those who have not had equal privileges.
Thus may`'st thou, dear youth,
be encouraged and increasingly willing to take up thy daily cross,
and follow thy Heavenly Father in the way of His leadings.
Thereby thou wilt be an example to thy contemporaries,
and enabled to hold forth the encouraging language to them: '`Come,
let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob,
and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths.`'

I feel my mind clothed with desires for thy encouragement in the way that leads to peace;
and remain thy affectionate aunt,

"`8th month 7th 1863.
After a season of close exerise, which seemed almost too weighty for me,
in the prospect of paying a visit to the soldiers who were encamped not far from us,
the liberty of the Select members of our Monthly Meeting was obtained.
I went according to appointment,
and saw such of them as were willing and at liberty to gather around us.
Although sadness covered my spirit in beholding them,
yet I was favored to get through the weighty service to my humbling admiration.
May all the praise be given to Him to whom alone it belongs.

"`8th month 19th. Feeling exercised and tried with doubts and fears, lest I may,
through inadvertency, have cast a stumbling block in the way of any,
the secret breathing of my spirit is that more carefulness, more watchfulness,
even unto prayer, may be maintained; that so more purity of heart may be experienced.
Mayest Thou, O Father, who art in heaven! condescend to be a light to my feet,
and a lamp to my path,
and enable me to follow Thee whithersoever Thou art pleased to lead:
and cast me not off in the time of old age, nor forsake me when my strength faileth.
The foregoing was written in my chamber, having been indisposed for more than a week.

"`9th mo, 17th. Fifth-day.
Went to meeting in poverty of spirit, which is much my portion.
I had not sat long before a few words weightily impressed my mind,
encouraging us to faithfulness; believing that those who are, would be enabled to say,
from time to time,
'`thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ.`' After expressing what arose,
my beloved young relative S. E. appeared in solemn supplication.
It felt to me a favored season.

"`20th. Being exercised in meeting today with the apprehension that there were some
present who were endeavoring to understand spiritual things in their own will and wisdom,
I became impressed with the language of the Most High through his prophet:
'`My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me,
the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns,
that can hold no water.`' After expressing the foregoing with the desire which accompanied,
that there might not be a looking outward, but looking inward,
as spiritual things were only spiritually known, etc.,
my mind was favored with a comfortable degree of quiet trust.`"

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++Perhaps there never was a time, when such an exercise as the above of our dear friend,
would seem to be more called for,
or when there was more danger of our religion resting in the rational powers,
rather than being seated in the heart: where, it may be first but as a little leaven,
but still that which, as it is allowed to operate, leavens the whole character;
bringing it into willing and sweet subjection to the Lord our righteousness.
In the parable,
it was not in the wise and knowing head that the good seed of the
kingdom or "`word of God`" was sown and brought forth fruit,
but "`in an honest and good heart.`"
Neither, in another New Testament record, though their hearts burned within them,
could the disciples of a crucified and risen Master
understand the things concerning the kingdom;
nay, their eyes were holden that they should not know the Lord of life and glory Himself,
until opened by Him.
As it is written, "`Then opened he their understanding,
that they might understand the Scriptures;`" and "`expounded
unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.`"
How true it is, that the understanding may be informed,
while the heart remains unenlightened and unchanged.
For "`the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:
for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them,
because they are spiritually discerned.`"
Hence it is "`Not by might nor by power: but by my Spirit,
saith the Lord of hosts,`" that what is done can be done to any purpose.]

[.small-break]
'''

"`9th month 27th. To be able to assemble with my
friends in order to perform Divine worship,
is a privilege of no small value.
Feeling drawn into sympathy with some who might feel poor and needy,
and ready to say with David,
'`Are his mercies clean gone forever?`' a few words
were spoken by way of encouragement to such;
for which I felt no condemnation.

"`30th. I was favored to get to our Monthly Meeting.
Our friends H. W., and P. W. R., attended.
They both appeared in testimony, and the latter in supplication in the first meeting.
It felt to me a time of renewed favor.
In that for Discipline,
there were two cases which gave rather more cause for exercise than usual;
after meeting my mind became low and discouraged, faith being at a low ebb.
In the evening, as I sat musing, with my mind turned towards the Lord,
I was renewedly and unexpectedly favored with strength to believe,
that if I was faithful to His guidance,
He would condescend to be with me the few remaining days of my pilgrimage:
which was cause of rejoicing,
and the renewal of trust and hope in Him who never said to the wrestling seed of Jacob,
'`seek ye my face in vain.`'

"`10th month 4th. This day it felt to me our meeting was
favored with a comfortable degree of solemnity in silence.

"`Having at different times through the day felt thoughtful,
and I believe I may say exercised respecting sending
some tracts on religious subjects to a public house,
where there may probably be more company than usual tomorrow,
this evening I feel my mind much relieved from it, lest it may be said,
'`Who hath required this at thy hand.`'`"

+++[+++Hannah Gibbons often quotes the aphorism of her dear Saviour and Lawgiver,
"`Without me ye can do nothing.`"
It is very observable that though she had been so
long acquainted with the voice of the good Shepherd,
yet with what scrupulousness and care she waits His bidding, when,
and as He is pleased to manifest Himself, lest even in what are accounted little things,
she should gradually slide from watchfulness unto prayer;
lest she should in any wise turn from His holy will, inwardly revealed;
lest she should compass a mountain in the wilderness,
or should bring upon herself the fearful interrogation and rebuke,
"`Who hath required this at thy hand?`"]

10th month 7th, 1863.

[.salutation]
My dear friend and cousin,

I have often thought of replying to thine of Sixth month last,
but frequent indisposition of body and poverty of spirit have been
so much my portion that I seemed to have no ability for it;
and now may not have anything to communicate worth thy notice;
but may say in reading thy very acceptable letter,
I was comforted in finding that I was so kindly remembered
by those who love the Lord Jesus,
often feeling low and discouraged, and not forgetting the language of David,
'`surely I am a worm and no man.`' These humiliating
feelings are not agreeable to our nature,
but no doubt are designed for the furtherance of the Gospel,
and to make us feel the verity of the dear Master`'s declaration,
'`Without me ye can do nothing:`' and surely we can not without His aid
do anything that will promote the blessed cause of truth and righteousness,
or our own soul`'s peace.
Thy expression of feeling me as a mother seems as though it does not belong to me,
often feeling myself far behind many of those who are younger in years,
thyself being one of that number.
I am frequently humbled under a sense of my own shortcomings.
The mention of thy own exercise was so far from burthening me,
that it seemed like face answering face in a glass.
I have often felt very tender sympathy with thee and thine,
when about leaving your former home and since; having experienced a similar trial.
I now remember afresh how it was with me when sitting by
the remains of my dear departed one in solemn silence,
the earnest petition of my heart was to the Father of mercies for myself and dear children,
that as He had been pleased to remove from us our outward stay and counsellor,
that He would condescend to be with us, be our guide and leader,
and that we might through His help be enabled to follow Him.

And I may say, that although many trials, besetments,
and discouragements have been my experience,
only known to Him who appointed or permitted them,
yet He has been pleased in matchless mercy, from season to season,
to bear up my head above the billows that seemed almost ready to overwhelm;
and I trust I may add to be '`as the shadow of a great rock in a weary
land,`' sustaining the weary traveller also as with a brook by the way.
Thus we have cause to say with the Psalmist,
'`thy rod and thy staff they comfort me;`' and to trust in the name of the Lord,
who I verily believe, regards the poor of the flock with tender compassion,
and continues to be a Father of the fatherless,
and a Judge of the widow in his holy habitation.

I was comforted in hearing that our late Yearly Meeting was a time of renewed favor;
a time wherein more of the cementing influence of heavenly
love was experienced than for some years before it.
Such seasons are cause of humble gratitude to the Author of all our blessings,
and times, I doubt not,
of renewing the faith of those who have none to look to for help but the Lord alone.
'`I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people,
and they shall trust in the name of the Lord;`' and now,
poor and unworthy as I often feel myself to be,
yet the encouraging language of our Divine Master flows towards thee, my precious cousin,
'`Fear thou not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God.
I will strengthen thee, yea I will help thee,
yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.`' It was
affecting to learn that thy dear brother William`'s sight continues declining.
Himself and dear children are oft-times remembered in tender sympathy.

Please give my love affectionately to thy dear daughters;
we should be pleased to see thyself or any of them here.
In a measure of that love which I trust waxeth not old,
I bid thee affectionately farewell.

"`10th month 15th, 1863.
I went to meeting in rather more infirmity of body than usual, and much exercise of mind.
I had not sat long before the spirit of supplication was, I believe,
experienced for myself and those assembled: and after our friend Mary Ann Lloyd,
from Philadelphia, had appeared in testimony, I ventured to bend the knee,
and to intercede with the Father of mercies,
that he would be pleased to enable us to keep our eye single
unto Him in this day of calamity and sore trial.
But not feeling my mind as much relieved and peaceful as at some other times,
the language arose: '`Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God,
ye may receive the promise.`'

"`16th. This morning before I arose it felt to me
the offering of yesterday was an acceptable one,
and a degree of peaceful quiet was afforded.
May I be thankful for every crumb that falls from the Master`'s table.

"`21st. Feeling much proved and tried,
I think I can adopt the language of Jane Pearson in the first stanza of a poem she composed,
and which I think is recorded in the account of her life^
footnote:[See Friends`' Library, vol.
4, p. 400.]
and is as follows:

[verse]
____
'`In age assist me dearest Lord,
In faith my spirit stay,
And if I`'ve err`'d through slavish fear,
Forgive me, Lord, I pray.

No other foes assail me now,
Nor prey upon my peace,
But false alarms and slavish fears:
Oh! cause those fears to cease.`'
____

"`I crave right direction, and that Thou, Father of mercies,
may be pleased to keep me in a safe path, free from all the wiles of an unwearied enemy.

"`11th month 8th. I was favored to sit with Friends in our meeting.
My mind was exercised in desire for myself and those gathered,
that our spiritual eye might be kept single to our Holy Head.
After expressing what arose, and bending the knee in supplication,
I felt a little strengthened to trust and hope in the Lord`'s mercy.

"`12th. As I lay in bed,
I trust I may say in humble intercession to our Almighty Father for right direction,
the situation of Abraham when about to offer his son Isaac, came impressively before me,
which afforded such relief, that I believed it was of a Divine nature.
Holy Father, wilt thou be pleased to preserve me from doubting again,
lest the enemy prevail against me.

"`26th. During our sitting together in meeting my
mind was sorrowfully impressed with fears,
lest a dividing spirit might be suffered to creep in among us;
and desires were felt and vocally expressed for our preservation.
The language of our Divine Master arose: '`He that is not with me is against me,
and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.`'
I felt renewedly concerned that we might each one,
by looking inward, be enabled to build over against our own house,
be favored to see eye to eye, and to walk by the same rule, and mind the same thing.
Being solemnly impressed with the spirit of supplication, it was yielded to,
wherein I was favored with a degree of sweetness which was precious.

"`12th month 8th. Having been poorly in body, and often low in mind,
I was encouraged this morning by reading the memorandums of my dear friend Jane Bettle;
with whom I was acquainted in early life.
Her pious example, with, as she expressed,
the need we have of watching unto prayer daily against the assaults of our soul`'s enemy,
is indeed worthy of our close attention.
Dearest Father! be pleased, I beseech Thee,
to enable me to keep near Thee in faith and hope; lest the enemy prevail against me.
For Thou alone art able to preserve.

"`23rd. Before I arose this morning, my mind being turned inward to the Lord,
being sensible it is only through His help that we
can be enabled to make straight steps to our feet,
desires were raised that I might be preserved from
bringing dishonor on the blessed Truth,
and enabled to fight the good fight of faith: for '`Without faith,
it is impossible to please God.`'`"

"`2nd month 14th, 1864.
The funeral of M. W., occurred, and feeling an engagement of mind to attend it,
I did so--it was a time of close exercise.`"

[.asterism]
'''

Here closes the memoranda of our dear mother as kept by herself.
We feel it due to her memory to add some of her expressions
during severe attacks of illness in 1857 and 1862;
as also to record some religious exercises the last four years of her life,
when unable to use the pen.

On the 19th of 1st month 1857,
our dear mother was prostrated with a chill followed by fever with symptoms of pneumonia.
After suffering between two and three weeks,
the disease yielded so far as to enable her to sit up occasionally,
and a few times to walk with assistance into the entry adjoining her chamber.
But about the 18th of 2nd month she became increasingly ill,
caused by inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach.
Her sufferings for many weeks was great at times,
inducing the belief with herself and those around her,
that the period of her release drew nigh.
But the healing Hand was extended,
so that on the 25th of 6th month she was able to come downstairs.

Being now so debilitated, as well as so aged, she never attended a Yearly Meeting again;
and but once a Quarterly Meeting.
But for several succeeding years she mostly got to our own, it being very near.

2nd month 1st, 1857.
Having read at her request a part of the second chapter of Luke,
and some verses of the 23rd Psalm, she said as follows: "`I think I feel no condemnation.
I have had many struggles, many secret conflicts,
known only to Him who knoweth the secrets of all hearts.
My way of getting along has been a little way, a one talent;
but as that has been improved, the penny has been given.
I think I feel an assurance that the Arms of mercy are open to receive me.`"

4th. "`It is the hidden life the enemy seeks to destroy,
and is unwearied in his endeavors for this end.
But what a mercy it is that '`He that is in you,
is greater than he that is in the world.`'
I have lived many days, and experienced many conflicts,
and though I have done but little for the Truth,
if I have been preserved from marring it, it is of His mercy in whom is all strength.
Many omissions and some commissions I have to acknowledge;
but I think I can appeal to the Searcher of hearts,
that it has been more through fear of putting a hand to the work unbidden,
than from wilful disobedience.
There are many passages of Scripture that seem at times as a sealed book,
which at other times open with encouragement.
I have been thinking of the passage in Revelations,
'`The wonder in Heaven--the woman clothed with the sun,
and the moon under her feet:`'`" and commented with interest on most of the chapter,
and though she did not wish at all to compare herself to the woman,
and it was a great thing for her to say it,
yet she thought she had known a being helped when
floods of discouragement seemed ready to overwhelm.
"`I want you, my dear children, to be faithful; though trials attend,
which may seem at times as the blast of the terrible one,
yet as we put our trust in the Lord alone,
He will put the armies of the aliens to flight,
and we shall know a coming off victorious:
to these He will give a white stone and a new name.
It was brought to my remembrance,`" she continued, "`at a time of deep exercise,
that the candlesticks in the Lord`'s house were to be made of beaten gold,
implying that the work of preparation for His service must be thorough.`"

On the morning of Second month 10th,
she requested her children to sit down in her chamber, and after a little silence,
she said,
"`My aspirations on your behalf have been frequent and fervent,--indeed
I may say you are the children of many prayers:
but, as no man can redeem his brother, or give to God a ransom for him,
I want each of you to seek the Truth for your selves.
If you live you will have many conflicts, many trials,
and may at times be ready to conclude you are forsaken.
Seasons of this kind are permitted for our refinement, and self-abasement;
but He who '`knoweth our frame,
and remembereth we are dust`' will not suffer his seeking
children to be tried above what He will enable them to bear.
His name is a strong tower, whereunto the righteous run, and find safety.`"

3rd month 27th. When suffering from extreme sickness and headache, she said,
"`if it would please my Heavenly Father to release me, what a favor it would be;
but I desire to bear it with patience and resignation.`"
The belief being expressed that the everlasting Arm was underneath for her support,
she replied, "`though I have passed through seasons of poverty, of strippedness,
and conflict, of latter time more than in the early part of my sickness,
yet I desire not to let go my confidence and trust; but as my dear father said,
I hope through adorable mercy I shall be admitted within the gate.`"

31st. A friend, with one of her daughters, being in the room, she said,
"`I desire you may be of the truly humble-minded.
These the true Shepherd enables to distinguish between His voice and that of the stranger.`"

4th month 15th. Being very ill, she said,
"`I should be glad my dear absent children were here.
Give my love to them if I do not live to see them again:
my heart is expanded in love to the whole human family.
Heavenly Father! wilt Thou be near me.
Through thy adorable mercy I feel nothing in my way!
Holy One! be pleased to receive my spirit.
I sometimes query why my sufferings are thus prolonged.
But oh! enable me to bear with patience all thy varied dispensations.`"

18th. "`Oh! that I might be permitted to join the heavenly host; and that thou,
my dear child, in due time may follow me.
I trust thy Heavenly Father will care for thee and
keep thee as in the hollow of his Holy Hand;
and he will do so if thou continue to live in His fear.`"

19th. On hearing of a Friend being exercised in the
Select Yearly Meeting on the subject of silent,
reverential waiting, and recommending it as one of our peculiar privileges, she said,
"`It did me good to hear it.
Oh! this is what we want as a Society, even silent waiting before the Most High.
This wordy spirit which is among us, I don`'t know what it will come to:
and yet I would not check the lisping of a babe in Christ Jesus.
A few words fitly spoken are compared to apples of gold in pictures of silver.`"

On the same day she said,
"`I think it was Samuel Emlen who expressed on the
bed of death,--'`It is an awful thing to die!
The invisible world, how awful!`' I think I may say the same:
but what a mercy it is to have a well grounded hope of a happy immortality.
How many encouraging passages,`" she continued, "`there are in the Scriptures of truth;
such as '`One is your Master, even Christ,`' etc.,
and '`God is no respecter of persons,`'`"etc.
On the same evening she said to her daughter,
"`Thy unwearied efforts for my comfort are grateful; but I want thee to let me go.`"

26th. In allusion to the late Yearly Meeting, she said;
"`I think I saw on Seventh-day morning with undoubted clearness,
that if Friends gathered under feelings of reverence and
holy fear--fear to offend--and if anything was expressed,
if it was under the same precious influence, it would have a tendency to gather;
but if the wisdom of man got up, striving to do a great deal,
it would make scattering work;`" adding,
"`it is only that which comes from above can gather there.
Oh! that the great '`I Am`' may govern.`"
On being informed it was thought a better feeling prevailed, she said,
"`this is what we want;`" and seemed greatly comforted.
Near this time she repeated,

[verse]
____
"`I thank Thee for Thy mercies past
And humbly hope for more.`"
____

Soon after, when extremely sick, the language was feebly uttered, "`Lord,
be with me,`" and immediately she fainted; on reviving, she said,
"`what a holy solemnity!`"

28th. When very weak, she said, "`Oh! that I might depart and be with Christ.`"
During the day some white violets were brought to her.
On smelling them, she said, "`How sweet and beautiful!
I thought some time ago, if I should live to see the beautiful flowers again,
I should enjoy them more than ever.
The thought arose, all things are possible; and I have lived to see them.`"
Near this time she expressed,
"`I have often in the feeling of my long continued weakness, thought of the passage,
'`Hath this man sinned, or his parents,
that he was born blind?`'`" and repeating the answer, continued,
"`I think my being sustained in so much suffering,
is to show forth the power of the Almighty.
At another time she thus expressed herself: "`When I awoke last night,
the language presented, '`In all their affliction He was afflicted,
and the angel of his presence saved them.`' I believe
it was said in reference to Christ`'s church;
but I thought then, as at other times, it might be applied to individuals.
I have passed through much weakness, but have been wonderfully sustained.
I think it has been my concern to live in the fear of the Lord from my youth up; and now,
unworthy as I am, He does not forsake me.`"
And again,
"`What an unspeakable favor it is not to have a guilty conscience at such a time as this.
I trust my sins have gone beforehand to judgment; and, through adorable mercy,
I have an abiding hope that my heavenly Father will receive my spirit.`"

5th month 2nd. In the night, when suffering, and unable to sleep, she said,
"`I have desired if anything remains for me to do, it may be shown me.`"
And again, though desiring to be released, she craved patience to wait the
Lord`'s time.
On reading to her a letter from a friend,
who spoke of her (Hannah Gibbon`'s) christian example, she said,
"`I wonder why my friends should think thus of me, unworthy as I feel.
I sometimes fear it may have a tendency to settle me in a false rest,
without trying the ground for myself: but I have endeavored to examine,
and am favored to feel nothing in my way--an unspeakable mercy.
Though many passages of Scripture occur, I do not feel worthy to apply them to myself:
such as, '`I have graven thee on the palms of my hands,`' etc.
I sometimes fear I may be deceiving myself and others; but I have a hope.
The hope of the hypocrite faileth, but mine does not fail.`"

To her daughter A., she said, "`It is remarkable how things occur to me since lying here,
that happened long ago.
I now remember when Rebecca Young and Deborah Darby were at my father`'s,
and about to leave,
they did not feel easy without having us children called into the parlor:
when one of them addressed me as follows: '`Be thou faithful in the Lord,
and thou wilt be a blessing to many; be thou faithful in the Lord,
and thou wilt be a blessing to the church.`' I have often thought of it since,
and as often have felt my own weakness.
I remember she also said, '`Who are fit for the Lord`'s service,
but those who feel their own unfitness!`"

1st month 31st, 1862.
Our dear mother was again taken ill, which was followed by several months of suffering;
during which, at times, her life was despaired of.
But, contrary to expectation or her own desire,
she recovered so as to get downstairs the 10th of Sixth month; and Seventh month 13th,
she was able to attend meeting.

A few days after this attack, she remarked to a friend,
"`I have had a time of suffering since I saw thee: but, for the most part,
my mind has been centered in peaceful quiet, which I esteem an unmerited favor.
I believe that He who has been with me all my life long, does not forsake me in old age.`"

At one time, she said, "`I think it an awful thing to die.
I have often looked over the leaves of my life,
and think I may say I feel nothing in my way; which is surely of the Lord`'s mercy.
I hope, my dear child, thou wilt be cared for,
which perhaps will be the case beyond thy expectation.
I have suffered often, and if it is the Lord`'s will to continue me in suffering,
I hope He will give me strength equal to all He may lay upon me;`" adding,
"`I have been an unprofitable servant.`"

3rd month 10th, she was greatly prostrated.
Her physician being present, she said,
"`he need not fear to tell me when he thinks the change is near.`"

19th. She asked to have the text read, "`Can a woman forget her suckling child,`" etc.,
saying, "`it has occurred to me with encouragement.
Sometimes I seem left to myself, and cannot so well bear my sufferings.
But as in the outward, day and night succeed each other,
so it is in our spiritual experience.`"
A few days after she remarked to a friend: "`This has been a suffering illness.
Patience sometimes seemed almost ready to fail, with scarcely any ability to ask for more.
At other times (I hope it is not too much for me
to say) I am comforted with Heavenly good.
'`I have graven thee on the palms of my hands,`' etc.,
has been remembered to my consolation.`"

22nd. Brother A.,
his wife and sister being with us, mother addressed us on
the importance of heeding the monitions of Divine grace;
saying, "`it will do great things for you.`"

29th. After a time of suffering from extreme sickness, by which she was much exhausted,
upon something being done for her comfort, she said:
"`It is a great favor to be so kindly cared for.
I have some doubts and conflicts of spirit; but I have a blessed hope, which,
with thankfulness I think I may say, does not fail.`"

On the 27th of 2nd month 1864,
our dear mother had a slight paralytic affection
which enfeebled her right hand and affected her speech.
From this time until her death she was almost wholly confined to bed.
Poverty of spirit and discouragement were much her experience, partly, no doubt,
from nervous weakness: yet through all, some seasons of consolation were granted.

4th month 6th. She said, "`Passages of Scripture often revive;`" and repeated,
"`The Lord is my shepherd,`" etc., and, "`He shall cover thee with his feathers,
and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.`"
Adding, "`but I cannot take this to myself:`" and dwelt much on her unworthiness,
and that she had nothing to trust to but the Lord`'s mercy.

5th month 29th. To a friend she said, "`Poverty of spirit is much my portion;
but I have hope in the goodness and mercy of my blessed Saviour.`"

6th month 12th. She revived the desire for patience; saying,
"`I suppose you think I am often lacking in it,
but I feel many wants without ability to help myself.
It is a condition I have often looked towards,
but the reality is different from anticipation.`"
Being told she bore her suffering with much resignation, it seemed to comfort her.

7th month 4th. When in much pain she said,
"`If these afflictions which are but for a moment,
work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,
what a mercy it will be.
My great desire is to wait the Lord`'s time;
and that I may not cast away the shield of faith as though it had not been anointed.`"

29th. Being distressed with nervous restlessness, she said, "`I beg for patience;
but from feeling so badly, I sometimes think I am like a fretful child.
On being told she did not appear so,
and it was believed much of her discomfort arose from nervous debility,`" she replied,
"`I think it must be so.
I have loved the Lord from my youth, and endeavored to serve Him:
and now have nothing to trust to but His mercy.
I sometimes think I see nothing in my way.`"

"`This grievous war, with brother arrayed against brother,
is very distressing to my feelings.
Oh! how often do I desire that the Lord would turn the hearts of the people to Himself,
even as a man turneth a water-course in the field.
That wars and fightings may cease, and peace be restored to our once peaceful land.
The gospel dispensation was ushered in with '`Glory to God in the highest:
on earth peace and good will to men.`' Truly the
time has come when '`Vain is the help of man.`'`"

No date.
She spoke of the comfort of having religious sympathizing friends to visit her:
but desired more and more to be in the quiet, saying, "`I love the quiet habitation,
where neither galley with oars nor gallant ship shall enter.`"

8th month 6th. Having a severe time from distressing sickness she said, "`My dear child,
thy unwearied efforts for my relief,
demand my grateful acknowledgment and thankfulness to our Father in Heaven;
who continues to strengthen thee in mind and body to administer to my comfort.
I have remembered, '`Whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth.`' I seem chastened,
but trust it is all in mercy for my refinement and purification.
And if I am only ready for the call,
it will be through the mercy of God in Christ Jesus.`"

7th. First-day.
She spoke, as she frequently had done, of the privilege of attending religious meetings;
and greatly desired our young people might value these opportunities:
and that they may embrace the visitations of Heavenly love and mercy,
and regard them with reverence and holy fear.

9th month 4th. Dear mother said,
"`The present seems to me a very serious time on account of the desolating war;
and I think it behooves each one of us to examine our standing,
and know whether we are building on the Rock or on the sand.
'`Watch and pray lest ye enter into temptation,`' is as needful
now as when the command was given by our blessed Saviour.
But how true it is the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
I often feel myself a poor creature, with nothing but mercy to trust to; and added,
'`Not by works of righteousness which we have done,`'"`etc.

12th month 28th, 1864.
Having an increase of feebleness in her left hand, and being otherwise more indisposed,
she said, "`How I long for a more abiding sense of acceptance with my Heavenly Father!
But I desire to say, '`though he slay me, yet will I trust in Him.`' For,
'`to whom shall we go?
Thou hast the words of eternal life.`' I think I
may say I have loved the truth from my youth,
though I have done little for it.`"

3rd month 12th, 1865.
Mother feeling her mind religiously exercised towards a
person whom she saw pass from the house of a neighbor,
yet being fearful to act, she thus supplicated:
"`Oh Heavenly Father! enable me to do thy blessed will; lest,
after all I have known of Thee,
I may slide as some have slidden from thy holy commandments.
Oh! give me to see with clearness the things which
belong to thy honor and my soul`'s peace.`"

4th month 5th, 1865.
Dear mother is more comfortable today,
and is able to select some tracts for distribution; but remarked as before,
on similar occasions,
"`I have more need to be concerned for myself;`" reviving
the desire to be prepared for the solemn summons.

5th month 7th. Seeing her in the evening very weary and unable to change her position,
with an exercised mind also, it was proposed to have a chair with wheels,
so that she could be moved from one part of the chamber to another.
She said, "`My dear child, it is very kind of thee:
but I sometimes think of Isaac Penington`'s language, '`Nothing but Christ,
nothing but Christ.`' I think our Saviour said,
'`Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.`' To have Him for our friend,
and to be His friend, is more than any earthly attainment.`"

7th month 21st. When in much pain she remarked, "`My suffering is great;
and the Lord only knows why it is so.
May He grant me patience to bear it, until He is pleased to say it is enough.`"

12th month 26th. Under exercise,
without being able to discern clearly the pointings
of duty (which is much her experience) she said,
"`I think my Heavenly Father knows there is nothing I so
much desire as a quiet mind and an approving conscience;
and why I am thus tossed I do not know:
but if it is designed for my furtherance in best things, I desire to be resigned.`"

5th month 2nd, 1866.
After a suffering day she repeated, "`I have nothing to trust to but mercy.
I think it is a favor to have faith that the foundation of God standeth sure.`"

8th. Feeling herself very ill in the night, she said,
"`My hope is in the mercy and goodness of my blessed Saviour;
and I think I feel He is near me.
If I do not live to see my dear children again,
tell them I desire they may keep their religious duty first in view,
and let worldly concerns be of a secondary nature.`"

6th month 6th. Mother repeated the language, "`Cast me not off in the time of old age,
forsake me not when my strength faileth;`" adding,
"`if I could have evidence of my acceptance it would be an unspeakable favor;
but I may have much yet to suffer; and if so,
I trust patience will be given equal to the day.`"

18th. When in much suffering, she said, "`Lord, increase my faith,
and the things I know not, teach Thou me.`"

7th month 2nd. She was attacked with violent pain,
attended with other distressing symptoms,
such as to induce the belief that her close drew near.
After a time of great weakness, she said, "`I can adopt the language of Samuel Emlen,
near the close of his life,
that the kindness of dear children and near relations I esteem a blessing from Heaven.`"
To aunt M. G., she remarked,
"`What a favor to have thee to comfort my dear daughter in this time of trial,
in which we seem about to be separated, after having lived so many years in near unity;
and, according to our little measure, gospel fellowship.`"

30th. Being very sick in the afternoon, followed by a disturbed night, she said,
"`How I long for the rest of Heaven!`"
Such expressions being generally followed by that
of a desire to be preserved from a murmuring spirit.

31st. In the evening she expressed as follows: "`I often think at the close of the day,
whether it has been spent in a manner consistent with a disciple of Jesus Christ.
I think it is my daily desire to live so as to have
the approbation of Him who seeth not as man seeth.`"

9th month 16th. When suffering much, she said, "`Why am I so long detained here?
May I be strengthened to bear all as I ought.
Not my will, O Lord, but Thine be done!
Be pleased to renew my faith.`"

30th. The past two weeks, mother has felt the effects of a heavy cold,
with increased cough and oppression.
The weary spirit often longs for a release;
yet submission to the Divine will is the daily desire of her heart.

3rd month 28th, 1867.
Feeling unusually weak and prostrated, she said,
"`It seems an intimation to prepare for the close.
May the Lord sustain me unto the end, and my dear children also.`"

5th month 22nd. On parting with our brother,
mother revived the language of her father to her on his first visit after her marriage.
"`Farewell my dear child,
don`'t let the good things of this life choke the
better seed. Perhaps I may never see thee again.
My hope and trust are in Jesus Christ my Saviour.`"

11th month. In allusion to a son-in-law and daughter coming to spend the winter with us,
mother said, "`May we all be established on the only sure foundation, Christ Jesus.
I often remember the language, '`Him that cometh unto me,
I will in no wise cast out.`' I do endeavor to come unto Him.`"

No date.
Our dear mother passed the winter in better health than usual;
though she often suffered from weariness and nervous restlessness, particularly at night.
Her desire for patience to wait the Lord`'s time for her release was often expressed;
as also were her blessings recounted.
A deep and almost an abiding sense of her unworthiness attended,
and the expression that she had nothing to trust to but the mercy of God in Christ Jesus,
was often repeated.

3rd month 26th, 1868.
Mother passed the day pretty comfortably,
reading late in the afternoon a chapter in the bible containing
a passage she wished to see--in the evening she had a chill followed
by symptoms of pneumonia which closed her life in one week.
During this time her mind occasionally wandered but
there were intervals of brightness throughout.
At one time she said she hoped her iniquities and shortcomings
would be forgiven and remembered no more.
When suffering from pain and oppression,
she expressed to a relative that she desired to be preserved from a murmuring spirit,
and enabled to adopt the language, "`Though he slay me yet will I trust in him.`"
Passages of Scripture were often repeated; such as, "`This is the way, walk ye in it.`"
"`The Bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him.`"
On Fourth-day night she supplicated thus, "`Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done, forever, and forever, and forever.`"
The hope being expressed that when the summons came it would be joyful to her,
she replied, "`I think I may say with dear William Jackson,
'`I have a hope that when done with the things of time,
I shall be admitted into the assembly of the just of all generations.`'`" At another time,
"`Oh Lord! my only Helper, keep and preserve my soul I pray Thee;
lest after all I have known of Thee, I slide as many have slidden,
from the path of Thy holy commandments.`"

Fifth day, the last of her precious life on earth,
was one of great weakness and suffering.
Though expression was attempted, articulation had become so difficult,
that but little could be understood.
In the evening she said something about being released, and queried, "`Why do I linger?`"
A little after, "`I am such a poor creature!`"
Her little remaining strength was now fast declining,
and near 11 o`'clock in the evening of Fourth month 2nd, 1868,
and when aged about 97 years and two months, her weary,
waiting spirit was gently released from its suffering tenement: and, we cannot doubt,
was permitted to enter that rest so often longed for.
